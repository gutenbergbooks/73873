<p><em>“The Unknown Masterpiece” is considered
not only one of the finest of Balzac’s tales, but
he himself considered it a valuable addition to
his “Philosophical Studies.” Balzac, born at
Tours, 1799, died at Paris, 1850, gives one the
impression of father confessor to unfortunate
women of the world and of the demi-monde—a
Samuel Richardson, but with far deeper,
broader sympathies. In Paris he lived a life
of privation, writing volumes of unsuccessful
things. The first novel that appeared under
his own name was “The Last Chouan,” 1827;
his first success “The Ass’s Skin,” 1830.</em></p>

<p><em>The idea of combining under the general
title of “Comédie Humaine” that long series
of great novels, which rose to their highest
level in “Eugénie Grandet,” did not occur to
him until later.</em></p>

<h3>I<br>
<em>GILLETTE</em></h3>

<p>On a cold December morning in the year 1612,
a young man, whose clothing was somewhat
of the thinnest, was walking to and fro before
a gateway in the Rue des Grands-Augustins in Paris.
He went up and down the street before this house
with the irresolution of a gallant who dares not venture
into the presence of the mistress whom he loves
for the first time, easy of access though she may be;
but after a sufficiently long interval of hesitation, he
at last crossed the threshold and inquired of an old
woman, who was sweeping out a large room on the
ground floor, whether Master Porbus was within.
Receiving a reply in the affirmative, the young man
went slowly up the staircase, like a gentleman but
newly come to court, and doubtful as to his reception
by the king. He came to a stand once more on the
landing at the head of the stairs, and again he hesitated
before raising his hand to the grotesque knocker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1008">[Pg 1008]</span>
on the door of the studio, where doubtless the painter
was at work—Master Porbus, sometime painter in
ordinary to Henri IV till Mary de’ Medici took Rubens
into favor.</p>

<p>The young man felt deeply stirred by an emotion
that must thrill the hearts of all great artists when,
in the pride of their youth and their first love of art,
they come into the presence of a master or stand before
a masterpiece. For all human sentiments there is a
time of early blossoming, a day of generous enthusiasm
that gradually fades until nothing is left of happiness
but a memory, and glory is known for a delusion. Of
all these delicate and short-lived emotions, none so resemble
love as the passion of a young artist for his
art, as he is about to enter on the blissful martyrdom
of his career of glory and disaster, of vague expectations
and real disappointments.</p>

<p>Those who have missed this experience in the early
days of light purses; who have not, in the dawn of
their genius, stood in the presence of a master and felt
the throbbing of their hearts, will always carry in their
inmost souls a chord that has never been touched, and
in their work an indefinable quality will be lacking, a
something in the stroke of the brush, a mysterious
element that we call poetry. The swaggerers, so puffed
up by self-conceit that they are confident oversoon of
their success, can never be taken for men of talent
save by fools. From this point of view, if youthful
modesty is the measure of youthful genius, the stranger
on the staircase might be allowed to have something
in him; for he seemed to possess the indescribable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1009">[Pg 1009]</span>
diffidence, the early timidity that artists are bound to
lose in the course of a great career, even as pretty
women lose it as they make progress in the arts of
coquetry. Self-distrust vanishes as triumph succeeds
to triumph, and modesty is, perhaps, distrust of itself.</p>

<p>The poor neophyte was so overcome by the consciousness
of his own presumption and insignificance,
that it began to look as if he was hardly likely to
penetrate into the studio of the painter, to whom we
owe the wonderful portrait of Henri IV. But fate was
propitious; an old man came up the staircase. From
the quaint costume of this newcomer, his collar of
magnificent lace, and a certain serene gravity in his
bearing, the first arrival thought that this personage
must be either a patron or a friend of the court painter.
He stood aside therefore upon the landing to allow
the visitor to pass, scrutinizing him curiously the while.
Perhaps he might hope to find the good nature of an
artist or to receive the good offices of an amateur not
unfriendly to the arts; but besides an almost diabolical
expression in the face that met his gaze, there was that
indescribable something which has an irresistible attraction
for artists.</p>

<p>Picture that face. A bald high forehead and rugged
jutting brows above a small flat nose turned up at the
end, as in the portraits of Socrates and Rabelais; deep
lines about the mocking mouth; a short chin, carried
proudly, covered with a grizzled pointed beard; sea-green
eyes that age might seem to have dimmed were
it not for the contrast between the iris and the surrounding
mother-of-pearl tints, so that it seemed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1010">[Pg 1010]</span>
if under the stress of anger or enthusiasm there would
be a magnetic power to quell or kindle in their glances.
The face was withered beyond wont by the fatigue of
years, yet it seemed aged still more by the thoughts
that had worn away both soul and body. There were
no lashes to the deep-set eyes, and scarcely a trace of
the arching lines of the eyebrows above them. Set
this head on a spare and feeble frame, place it in a
frame of lace wrought like an engraved silver fish-slice,
imagine a heavy gold chain over the old man’s
black doublet, and you will have some dim idea of
this strange personage, who seemed still more fantastic
in the sombre twilight of the staircase. One of Rembrandt’s
portraits might have stepped down from its
frame to walk in an appropriate atmosphere of gloom,
such as the great painter loved. The older man gave
the younger a shrewd glance, and knocked thrice at the
door. It was opened by a man of forty or thereabout,
who seemed to be an invalid.</p>

<p>“Good day, Master.”</p>

<p>Porbus bowed respectfully, and held the door open
for the younger man to enter, thinking that the latter
accompanied his visitor; and when he saw that the
neophyte stood a while as if spellbound, feeling, as
every artist-nature must feel, the fascinating influence
of the first sight of a studio in which the material processes
of art are revealed, Porbus troubled himself no
more about this second comer.</p>

<p>All the light in the studio came from a window in
the roof, and was concentrated upon an easel, where a
canvas stood untouched as yet save for three or four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1011">[Pg 1011]</span>
outlines in chalk. The daylight scarcely reached the
remoter angles and corners of the vast room; they
were as dark as night, but the silver ornamented
breastplate of a Reiter’s corselet, that hung upon the
wall, attracted a stray gleam to its dim abiding-place
among the brown shadows; or a shaft of light shot
across the carved and glistening surface of an antique
sideboard covered with curious silver-plate, or
struck out a line of glittering dots among the raised
threads of the golden warp of some old brocaded curtains,
where the lines of the stiff, heavy folds were
broken, as the stuff had been flung carelessly down to
serve as a model.</p>

<p>Plaster <em>écorchés</em> stood about the room; and here and
there, on shelves and tables, lay fragments of classical
sculpture—torsos of antique goddesses, worn smooth
as though all the years of the centuries that had passed
over them had been lovers’ kisses. The walls were
covered, from floor to ceiling, with countless sketches
in charcoal, red chalk, or pen and ink. Amid the litter
and confusion of color boxes, overturned stools, flasks
of oil, and essences, there was just room to move so as
to reach the illuminated circular space where the easel
stood. The light from the window in the roof fell full
upon Porbus’s pale face and on the ivory-tinted forehead
of his strange visitor. But in another moment
the younger man heeded nothing but a picture that
had already become famous even in those stormy days
of political and religious revolution, a picture that a
few of the zealous worshipers, who have so often kept
the sacred fire of art alive in evil days, were wont to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1012">[Pg 1012]</span>
go on pilgrimage to see. The beautiful panel represented
a Saint Mary of Egypt about to pay her passage
across the seas. It was a masterpiece destined for
Mary de’ Medici, who sold it in later years of poverty.</p>

<p>“I like your saint,” the old man remarked, addressing
Porbus. “I would give you ten golden crowns for
her over and above the price the Queen is paying;
but as for putting a spoke in that wheel—the devil
take it!”</p>

<p>“It is good then?”</p>

<p>“Hey! hey!” said the old man; “good, say you?—Yes
and no. Your good woman is not badly done, but
she is not alive. You artists fancy that when a figure
is correctly drawn, and everything in its place according
to the rules of anatomy, there is nothing more to
be done. You make up the flesh tints beforehand on
your palettes according to your formulæ, and fill in
the outlines with due care that one side of the face
shall be darker than the other; and because you look
from time to time at a naked woman who stands on the
platform before you, you fondly imagine that you have
copied nature, think yourselves to be painters, believe
that you have wrested His secret from God. Pshaw!
You may know your syntax thoroughly and make no
blunders in your grammar, but it takes that and something
more to make a great poet. Look at your saint,
Porbus! At a first glance she is admirable; look at
her again, and you see at once that she is glued to the
background, and that you could not walk round her.
She is a silhouette that turns but one side of her face
to all beholders, a figure cut out of canvas, an image<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1013">[Pg 1013]</span>
with no power to move nor change her position. I
feel as if there were no air between that arm and the
background, no space, no sense of distance in your canvas.
The perspective is perfectly correct, the strength
of the coloring is accurately diminished with the distance;
but, in spite of these praiseworthy efforts, I
could never bring myself to believe that the warm
breath of life comes and goes in that beautiful body.
It seems to me that if I laid my hand on the firm,
rounded throat, it would be cold as marble to the
touch. No, my friend, the blood does not flow beneath
that ivory skin, the tide of life does not flush
those delicate fibres, the purple veins that trace a network
beneath the transparent amber of her brow and
breast. Here the pulse seems to beat, there it is motionless,
life and death are at strife in every detail;
here you see a woman, there a statue, there again a
corpse. Your creation is incomplete. You had only
power to breathe a portion of your soul into your
beloved work. The fire of Prometheus died out again
and again in your hands; many a spot in your picture
has not been touched by the divine flame.”</p>

<p>“But how is it, dear master?” Porbus asked
respectfully, while the young man with difficulty
repressed his strong desire to beat the critic.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the old man, “it is this! You have
halted between two manners. You have hesitated between
drawing and color, between the dogged attention
to detail, the stiff precision of the German masters
and the dazzling glow, the joyous exuberance of Italian
painters. You have set yourself to imitate Hans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1014">[Pg 1014]</span>
Holbein and Titian, Albrecht Dürer and Paul Veronese
in a single picture. A magnificent ambition truly, but
what has come of it? Your work has neither the
severe charm of a dry execution nor the magical illusion
of Italian <em>chiaroscuro</em>. Titian’s rich golden coloring
poured into Albrecht Dürer’s austere outlines has
shattered them, like molten bronze bursting through
the mold that is not strong enough to hold it. In
other places the outlines have held firm, imprisoning
and obscuring the magnificent, glowing flood of Venetian
color. The drawing of the face is not perfect, the
coloring is not perfect; traces of that unlucky indecision
are to be seen everywhere. Unless you felt
strong enough to fuse the two opposed manners in the
fire of your own genius, you should have cast in your
lot boldly with the one or the other, and so have obtained
the unity which simulates one of the conditions
of life itself. Your work is only true in the centres;
your outlines are false, they project nothing, there is
no hint of anything behind them. There is truth
here,” said the old man, pointing to the breast of the
Saint, “and again here,” he went on, indicating the
rounded shoulder. “But there,” once more returning
to the column of the throat, “everything is false.
Let us go no further into detail; you would be disheartened.”</p>

<p>The old man sat down on a stool, and remained a
while without speaking, with his face buried in his
hands.</p>

<p>“Yet I studied that throat from the life, dear master,”
Porbus began; “it happens sometimes, for our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1015">[Pg 1015]</span>
misfortune, that real effects in nature look improbable
when transferred to canvas—”</p>

<p>“The aim of art is not to copy nature, but to express
it. You are not a servile copyist, but a poet!”
cried the old man sharply, cutting Porbus short with
an imperious gesture. “Otherwise a sculptor might
make a plaster cast of a living woman and save himself
all further trouble. Well, try to make a cast of
your mistress’s hand, and set up the thing before you.
You will see a monstrosity, a dead mass, bearing no
resemblance to the living hand; you would be compelled
to have recourse to the chisel of a sculptor who,
without making an exact copy, would represent for
you its movement and its life. We must detect the
spirit, the informing soul in the appearances of things
and beings. Effects! What are effects but the accidents
of life, not life itself? A hand, since I have
taken that example, is not only a part of a body, it is
the expression and extension of a thought that must
be grasped and rendered. Neither painter nor poet
nor sculptor may separate the effect from the cause,
which are inevitably contained the one in the other.
There begins the real struggle! Many a painter
achieves success instinctively, unconscious of the task
that is set before art. You draw a woman, yet you
do not see her! Not so do you succeed in wresting
Nature’s secrets from her! You are reproducing mechanically
the model that you copied in your master’s
studio. You do not penetrate far enough into the inmost
secrets of the mystery of form; you do not seek
with love enough and perseverance enough after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1016">[Pg 1016]</span>
form that baffles and eludes you. Beauty is a thing
severe and unapproachable, never to be won by a languid
lover. You must lie in wait for her coming and
take her unawares, press her hard and clasp her in a
tight embrace, and force her to yield. Form is a
Proteus more intangible and more manifold than the
Proteus of the legend; compelled, only after long
wrestling, to stand forth manifest in his true aspect.
Some of you are satisfied with the first shape, or at
most by the second or the third that appears. Not
thus wrestle the victors, the unvanquished painters
who never suffer themselves to be deluded by all those
treacherous shadow-shapes; they persevere till Nature
at the last stands bare to their gaze, and her very
soul is revealed.</p>

<p>“In this manner worked Rafael,” said the old man,
taking off his cap to express his reverence for the King
of Art. “His transcendent greatness came of the intimate
sense that, in him, seems as if it would shatter
external form. Form in his figures (as with us) is
a symbol, a means of communicating sensations, ideas,
the vast imaginings of a poet. Every face is a whole
world. The subject of the portrait appeared for him
bathed in the light of a divine vision; it was revealed
by an inner voice, the finger of God laid bare the
sources of expression in the past of a whole life.</p>

<p>“You clothe your women in fair raiment of flesh,
in gracious veiling of hair; but where is the blood, the
source of passion and of calm, the cause of the particular
effect? Why, this brown Egyptian of yours,
my good Porbus, is a colorless creature! These figures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1017">[Pg 1017]</span>
that you set before us are painted bloodless fantoms;
and you call that painting, you call that art!</p>

<p>“Because you have made something more like a
woman than a house, you think that you have set your
fingers on the goal; you are quite proud that you
need not to write <em>currus venustus</em> or <em>pulcher homo</em>
beside your figures, as early painters were wont to do
and you fancy that you have done wonders. Ah! my
good friend, there is still something more to learn,
and you will use up a great deal of chalk and cover
many a canvas before you will learn it. Yes, truly, a
woman carries her head in just such a way, so she
holds her garments gathered into her hand; her eyes
grow dreamy and soft with that expression of meek
sweetness, and even so the quivering shadow of the
lashes hovers upon her cheeks. It is all there, and yet
it is not there. What is lacking? A nothing, but that
nothing is everything.</p>

<p>“There you have the semblance of life, but you do
not express its fulness and effluence, that indescribable
something, perhaps the soul itself, that envelopes the
outlines of the body like a haze; that flower of life,
in short, that Titian and Rafael caught. Your utmost
achievement hitherto has only brought you to the starting-point.
You might now perhaps begin to do excellent
work, but you grow weary all too soon; and
the crowd admires, and those who know smile.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mabuse! oh, my master!” cried the strange
speaker, “thou art a thief! Thou hast carried away
the secret of life with thee!”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” he began again, “this picture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1018">[Pg 1018]</span>
yours is worth more than all the paintings of that
rascal Rubens, with his mountains of Flemish flesh
raddled with vermilion, his torrents of red hair, his
riot of color. You, at least have color there, and
feeling and drawing—the three essentials in art.”</p>

<p>The young man roused himself from his deep
musings.</p>

<p>“Why, my good man, the Saint is sublime!” he cried.
“There is a subtlety of imagination about those two
figures, the Saint Mary and the Shipman, that can not
be found among Italian masters; I do not know a
single one of them capable of imagining the Shipman’s
hesitation.”</p>

<p>“Did that little malapert come with you?” asked
Porbus of the older man.</p>

<p>“Alas! master, pardon my boldness,” cried the neophyte,
and the color mounted to his face. “I am unknown—a
dauber by instinct, and but lately come to
this city—the fountain-head of all learning.”</p>

<p>“Set to work,” said Porbus, handing him a bit of
red chalk and a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>The newcomer quickly sketched the Saint Mary
line for line.</p>

<p>“Aha!” exclaimed the old man. “Your name?” he
added.</p>

<p>The young man wrote “Nicolas Poussin” below the
sketch.</p>

<p>“Not bad that for a beginning,” said the strange
speaker, who had discoursed so wildly. “I see that we
can talk of art in your presence. I do not blame you
for admiring Porbus’s saint. In the eyes of the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1019">[Pg 1019]</span>
she is a masterpiece, and those alone who have been
initiated into the inmost mysteries of art can discover
her shortcomings. But it is worth while to give you
the lesson, for you are able to understand it, so I will
show you how little it needs to complete this picture.
You must be all eyes, all attention, for it may be that
such a chance of learning will never come in your way
again.—Porbus! your palette.”</p>

<p>Porbus went in search of palette and brushes. The
little old man turned back his sleeves with impatient
energy, seized the palette, covered with many hues, that
Porbus handed to him, and snatched rather than took
a handful of brushes of various sizes from the hands
of his acquaintance. His pointed beard suddenly
bristled—a menacing movement that expressed the
prick of a lover’s fancy. As he loaded his brush, he
muttered between his teeth, “These paints are only
fit to fling out of the window, together with the fellow
who ground them, their crudeness and falseness are
disgusting! How can one paint with this?”</p>

<p>He dipped the tip of the brush with feverish eagerness
in the different pigments, making the circuit of
the palette several times more quickly than the organist
of a cathedral sweeps the octaves on the keyboard of
his clavier for the “O Filii” at Easter.</p>

<p>Porbus and Poussin, on either side of the easel, stood
stock-still, watching with intense interest.</p>

<p>“Look, young man,” he began again, “see how three
or four strokes of the brush and a thin glaze of blue
let in the free air to play about the head of the poor
Saint, who must have felt stifled and oppressed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1020">[Pg 1020]</span>
close atmosphere! See how the drapery begins to flutter;
you feel that it is lifted by the breeze! A moment
ago it hung as heavily and stiffly as if it were held out
by pins. Do you see how the satin sheen that I have
just given to the breast rends the pliant, silken softness
of a young girl’s skin, and how the brown-red, blended
with burnt ochre, brings warmth into the cold gray of
the deep shadow where the blood lay congealed instead
of coursing through the veins? Young man, young
man, no master could teach you how to do this that I
am doing before your eyes. Mabuse alone possessed
the secret of giving life to his figures; Mabuse had but
one pupil—that was I. I have had none, and I am old.
You have sufficient intelligence to imagine the rest
from the glimpses that I am giving you.”</p>

<p>While the old man was speaking, he gave a touch
here and there; sometimes two strokes of the brush,
sometimes a single one; but every stroke told so well,
that the whole picture seemed transfigured—the painting
was flooded with light. He worked with such passionate
fervor that beads of sweat gathered upon his
bare forehead; he worked so quickly, in brief, impatient
jerks, that it seemed to young Poussin as if some
familiar spirit inhabiting the body of this strange
being took a grotesque pleasure in making use of the
man’s hands against his own will. The unearthly
glitter of his eyes, the convulsive movements that
seemed like struggles, gave to this fancy a semblance
of truth which could not but stir a young imagination.
The old man continued, saying as he did so—</p>

<p>“Paf! paf! that is how to lay it on, young man!—Little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1021">[Pg 1021]</span> 
touches! come and bring a glow into those icy
cold tones for me! Just so! Pon! pon! pon!” and
those parts of the picture that he had pointed out as
cold and lifeless flushed with warmer hues, a few bold
strokes of color brought all the tones of the picture
into the required harmony with the glowing tints of
the Egyptian, and the differences in temperament
vanished.</p>

<p>“Look you, youngster, the last touches make the
picture. Porbus has given it a hundred strokes for
every one of mine. No one thanks us for what lies
beneath. Bear that in mind.”</p>

<p>At last the restless spirit stopped, and turning to
Porbus and Poussin, who were speechless with admiration,
he spoke—</p>

<p>“This is not as good as my ‘Belle Noiseuse’; still
one might put one’s name to such a thing as this.—Yes,
I would put my name to it,” he added, rising to
reach for a mirror, in which he looked at the picture.—“And
now,” he said, “will you both come and breakfast
with me? I have a smoked ham and some very
fair wine!... Eh! eh! the times may be bad, but
we can still have some talk about art! We can talk
like equals.... Here is a little fellow who has
aptitude,” he added, laying a hand on Nicolas Poussin’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>In this way the stranger became aware of the threadbare
condition of the Norman’s doublet. He drew a
leather purse from his girdle, felt in it, found two gold
coins, and held them out.</p>

<p>“I will buy your sketch,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1022">[Pg 1022]</span></p>

<p>“Take it,” said Porbus, as he saw the other start
and flush with embarrassment, for Poussin had the
pride of poverty. “Pray, take it; he has a couple of
king’s ransoms in his pouch!”</p>

<p>The three came down together from the studio, and,
talking of art by the way, reached a picturesque wooden
house hard by the Pont Saint-Michel. Poussin wondered
a moment at its ornament, at the knocker, at
the frames of the casements, at the scroll-work designs,
and in the next he stood in a vast low-ceiled
room. A table, covered with tempting dishes, stood
near the blazing fire, and (luck unhoped for) he was
in the company of two great artists full of genial good
humor.</p>

<p>“Do not look too long at that canvas, young man,”
said Porbus, when he saw that Poussin was standing,
struck with wonder, before a painting. “You would
fall a victim to despair.”</p>

<p>It was the “Adam” painted by Mabuse to purchase
his release from the prison where his creditors had
so long kept him. And, as a matter of fact, the figure
stood out so boldly and convincingly, that Nicolas
Poussin began to understand the real meaning of the
words poured out by the old artist, who was himself
looking at the picture with apparent satisfaction, but
without enthusiasm. “I have done better than that!”
he seemed to be saying to himself.</p>

<p>“There is life in it,” he said aloud; “in that respect
my poor master here surpassed himself, but there is
some lack of truth in the background. The man lives
indeed; he is rising, and will come toward us; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1023">[Pg 1023]</span>
atmosphere, the sky, the air, the breath of the breeze—you
look and feel for them, but they are not there.
And then the man himself is, after all, only a man!
Ah! but the one man in the world who came direct
from the hands of God must have had a something
divine about him that is wanting here. Mabuse himself
would grind his teeth and say so when he was
not drunk.”</p>

<p>Poussin looked from the speaker to Porbus, and
from Porbus to the speaker, with restless curiosity.
He went up to the latter to ask for the name of their
host; but the painter laid a finger on his lips with an
air of mystery. The young man’s interest was excited;
he kept silence, but hoped that sooner or later
some word might be let fall that would reveal the
name of his entertainer. It was evident that he was
a man of talent and very wealthy, for Porbus listened
to him respectfully, and the vast room was crowded
with marvels of art.</p>

<p>A magnificent portrait of a woman, hung against
the dark oak panels of the wall, next caught Poussin’s
attention.</p>

<p>“What a glorious Giorgione!” he cried.</p>

<p>“No,” said his host, “it is an early daub of mine—”</p>

<p>“Gramercy! I am in the abode of the god of painting,
it seems!” cried Poussin ingenuously.</p>

<p>The old man smiled as if he had long grown
familiar with such praise.</p>

<p>“Master Frenhofer!” said Porbus, “do you think
you could spare me a little of your capital Rhine
wine?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1024">[Pg 1024]</span></p>

<p>“A couple of pipes!” answered his host; “one to
discharge a debt, for the pleasure of seeing your pretty
sinner, the other as a present from a friend.”</p>

<p>“Ah! if I had my health,” returned Porbus, “and
if you would but let me see your ‘Belle Noiseuse,’ I
would paint some great picture, with breadth in it
and depth; the figures should be life-size.”</p>

<p>“Let you see my work!” cried the painter in agitation.
“No, no! it is not perfect yet; something still
remains for me to do. Yesterday, in the dusk,” he
said, “I thought I had reached the end. Her eyes
seemed moist, the flesh quivered, something stirred
the tresses of her hair. She breathed! But though I
have succeeded in reproducing Nature’s roundness and
relief on the flat surface of the canvas, this morning,
by daylight, I found out my mistake. Ah! to achieve
that glorious result I have studied the works of the
great masters of color, stripping off coat after coat
of color from Titian’s canvas, analyzing the pigments
of the king of light. Like that sovereign painter, I
began the face in a slight tone with a supple and
fat paste—for shadow is but an accident; bear that
in mind, youngster!—Then I began afresh, and by
half-tones and thin glazes of color less and less transparent,
I gradually deepened the tints to the deepest
black of the strongest shadows. An ordinary painter
makes his shadows something entirely different in
nature from the high lights; they are wood or brass,
or what you will, anything but flesh in shadow. You
feel that even if those figures were to alter their
position, those shadow stains would never be cleansed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1025">[Pg 1025]</span>
away, those parts of the picture would never glow with
light.</p>

<p>“I have escaped one mistake, into which the most
famous painters have sometimes fallen; in my canvas
the whiteness shines through the densest and
most persistent shadow. I have not marked out
the limits of my figure in hard, dry outlines, and
brought every least anatomical detail into prominence
(like a host of dunces, who fancy that they
can draw because they can trace a line elaborately
smooth and clean), for the human body is not contained
within the limits of line. In this the sculptor
can approach the truth more nearly than we painters.
Nature’s way is a complicated succession of curve
within curve. Strictly speaking, there is no such
thing as drawing.—Do not laugh, young man; strange
as that speech may seem to you, you will understand
the truth in it some day.—A line is a method of expressing
the effect of light upon an object; but there
are no lines in Nature, everything is solid. We draw
by modeling, that is to say, that we disengage an
object from its setting; the distribution of the light
alone gives to a body the appearance by which we
know it. So I have not defined the outlines; I have
suffused them with a haze of half-tints warm or
golden, in such a sort that you can not lay your finger
on the exact spot where background and contours
meet. Seen from near, the picture looks a blur; it
seems to lack definition; but step back two paces, and
the whole thing becomes clear, distinct, and solid;
the body stands out; the rounded form comes into relief;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1026">[Pg 1026]</span>
you feel that the air plays round it. And yet—I
am not satisfied; I have misgivings. Perhaps one
ought not to draw a single line; perhaps it would be
better to attack the face from the centre, taking the
highest prominences first, proceeding from them
through the whole range of shadows to the heaviest
of all. Is not this the method of the sun, the divine
painter of the world? Oh, Nature, Nature! who has
surprised thee, fugitive? But, after all, too much
knowledge, like ignorance, brings you to a negation.
I have doubts about my work.”</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then the old man spoke again.
“I have been at work upon it for ten years, young
man; but what are ten short years in a struggle with
Nature? Do we know how long Sir Pygmalion
wrought at the one statue that came to life?”</p>

<p>The old man fell into deep musings, and gazed
before him with wide unseeing eyes, while he played
unheedingly with his knife.</p>

<p>“Look, he is in conversation with his <em>dæmon</em>!” murmured
Porbus.</p>

<p>At the word, Nicolas Poussin felt himself carried
away by an unaccountable accession of artist’s curiosity.
For him the old man, at once intent and inert,
the seer with the unseeing eyes, became something
more than a man—a fantastic spirit living in a
mysterious world, and countless vague thoughts awoke
within his soul. The effect of this species of fascination
upon his mind can no more be described in words
than the passionate longing awakened in an exile’s
heart by the song that recalls his home. He thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1027">[Pg 1027]</span>
of the scorn that the old man affected to display
for the noblest efforts of art, of his wealth, his manners,
of the deference paid to him by Porbus. The
mysterious picture, the work of patience on which he
had wrought so long in secret, was doubtless a work
of genius, for the head of the Virgin which young
Poussin had admired so frankly was beautiful even
beside Mabuse’s “Adam”—there was no mistaking
the imperial manner of one of the princes of art.
Everything combined to set the old man beyond the
limits of human nature.</p>

<p>Out of the wealth of fancies in Nicolas Poussin’s
brain an idea grew, and gathered shape and clearness.
He saw in this supernatural being a complete type
of the artist nature, a nature mocking and kindly,
barren and prolific, an erratic spirit intrusted with
great and manifold powers which she too often abuses,
leading sober reason, the Philistine, and sometimes
even the amateur forth into a stony wilderness where
they see nothing; but the white-winged maiden herself,
wild as her fancies may be, finds epics there and
castles and works of art. For Poussin, the enthusiast,
the old man, was suddenly transfigured, and
became Art incarnate, Art with its mysteries, its
vehement passion and its dreams.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear Porbus,” Frenhofer continued,
“hitherto I have never found a flawless model, a body
with outlines of perfect beauty, the carnations—Ah!
where does she live?” he cried, breaking in upon himself,
“the undiscoverable Venus of the older time,
for whom we have sought so often, only to find the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1028">[Pg 1028]</span>
scattered gleams of her beauty here and there? Oh!
to behold once and for one moment, Nature grown
perfect and divine, the Ideal at last, I would give all
that I possess.... Nay, Beauty divine, I would
go to seek thee in the dim land of the dead; like
Orpheus, I would go down into the Hades of Art to
bring back the life of art from among the shadows
of death.”</p>

<p>“We can go now,” said Porbus to Poussin. “He
neither hears nor sees us any longer.”</p>

<p>“Let us go to his studio,” said young Poussin,
wondering greatly.</p>

<p>“Oh! the old fox takes care that no one shall enter
it. His treasures are so carefully guarded that it is
impossible for us to come at them. I have not waited
for your suggestion and your fancy to attempt to lay
hands on this mystery by force.”</p>

<p>“So there is a mystery?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Porbus. “Old Frenhofer is the
only pupil Mabuse would take. Frenhofer became the
painter’s friend, deliverer, and father; he sacrificed
the greater part of his fortune to enable Mabuse to
indulge in riotous extravagance, and in return Mabuse
bequeathed to him the secret of relief, the power of
giving to his figures the wonderful life, the flower
of Nature, the eternal despair of art, the secret which
Mabuse knew so well that one day when he had sold
the flowered brocade suit in which he should have
appeared at the Entry of Charles V, he accompanied
his master in a suit of paper painted to resemble the
brocade. The peculiar richness and splendor of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1029">[Pg 1029]</span>
stuff struck the Emperor; he complimented the old
drunkard’s patron on the artist’s appearance, and so
the trick was brought to light. Frenhofer is a passionate
enthusiast, who sees above and beyond other painters.
He has meditated profoundly on color, and the
absolute truth of line; but by the way of much research
he has come to doubt the very existence of the
objects of his search. He says, in moments of despondency,
that there is no such thing as drawing, and
that by means of lines we can only reproduce
geometrical figures; but that is overshooting the mark,
for by outline and shadow you can reproduce form
without any color at all, which shows that our
art, like Nature, is composed of an infinite number
of elements. Drawing gives you the skeleton, the
anatomical framework, and color puts the life into
it; but life without the skeleton is even more incomplete
than a skeleton without life. But there is
something else truer still, and it is this—for painters,
practise and observation are everything; and when
theories and poetical ideas begin to quarrel with the
brushes, the end is doubt, as has happened with our
good friend, who is half crack-brained enthusiast,
half painter. A sublime painter! but unluckily for
him, he was born to riches, and so he has leisure to
follow his fancies. Do not you follow his example!
Work! painters have no business to think, except
brush in hand.”</p>

<p>“We will find a way into his studio!” cried Poussin
confidently. He had ceased to heed Porbus’s remarks.
The other smiled at the young painter’s enthusiasm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1030">[Pg 1030]</span>
asked him to come to see him again, and they parted.
Nicholas Poussin went slowly back to the Rue de la
Harpe, and passed the modest hostelry where he was
lodging without noticing it. A feeling of uneasiness
prompted him to hurry up the crazy staircase till he
reached a room at the top, a quaint, airy recess under
the steep, high-pitched roof common among houses
in old Paris. In the one dingy window of the place
sat a young girl, who sprang up at once when she
heard some one at the door; it was the prompting of
love; she had recognized the painter’s touch on the
latch.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“The matter is ... is.... Oh! I have felt
that I am a painter! Until to-day I have had doubts,
but now I believe in myself! There is the making
of a great man in me! Never mind, Gillette, we
shall be rich and happy! There is gold at the tips of
those brushes—”</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly. The joy faded from his
powerful and earnest face as he compared his vast
hopes with his slender resources. The walls were
covered with sketches in chalk on sheets of common
paper. There were but four canvases in the room.
Colors were very costly, and the young painter’s palette
was almost bare. Yet in the midst of his poverty he
possessed and was conscious of the possession of inexhaustible
treasures of the heart, of a devouring
genius equal to all the tasks that lay before him.</p>

<p>He had been brought to Paris by a nobleman among
his friends, or perchance by the consciousness of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1031">[Pg 1031]</span>
powers; and in Paris he had found a mistress, one
of those noble and generous souls who choose to
suffer by a great man’s side, who share his struggles
and strive to understand his fancies, accepting their
lot of poverty and love as bravely and dauntlessly as
other women will set themselves to bear the burden
of riches and make a parade of their insensibility.
The smile that stole over Gillette’s lips filled the garret
with golden light, and rivaled the brightness of
the sun in heaven. The sun, moreover, does not
always shine in heaven, whereas Gillette was always
in the garret, absorbed in her passion, occupied by
Poussin’s happiness and sorrow, consoling the genius
which found an outlet in love before art engrossed it.</p>

<p>“Listen, Gillette. Come here.”</p>

<p>The girl obeyed joyously, and sprang upon the
painter’s knee. Hers was perfect grace and beauty,
and the loveliness of spring; she was adorned with
all luxuriant fairness of outward form, lighted up by
the glow of a fair soul within.</p>

<p>“Oh! God,” he cried; “I shall never dare to tell
her—”</p>

<p>“A secret?” she cried; “I must know it!”</p>

<p>Poussin was absorbed in his dreams.</p>

<p>“Do tell it me!”</p>

<p>“Gillette ... poor beloved heart!...”</p>

<p>“Oh! do you want something of me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If you wish me to sit once more for you as I did
the other day,” she continued with playful petulance,
“I will never consent to do such a thing again, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1032">[Pg 1032]</span>
your eyes say nothing all the while. You do not think
of me at all, and yet you look at me—”</p>

<p>“Would you rather have me draw another woman?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps—if she were very ugly,” she said.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Poussin gravely, “and if, for the sake
of my fame to come, if to make me a great painter,
you must sit to some one else?”</p>

<p>“You may try me,” she said; “you know quite well
that I would not.”</p>

<p>Poussin’s head sank on her breast; he seemed to be
overpowered by some intolerable joy or sorrow.</p>

<p>“Listen,” she cried, plucking at the sleeve of
Poussin’s threadbare doublet. “I told you, Nick,
that I would lay down my life for you; but I never
promised you that I in my lifetime would lay down
my love.”</p>

<p>“Your love?” cried the young artist.</p>

<p>“If I showed myself thus to another, you would
love me no longer, and I should feel myself unworthy
of you. Obedience to your fancies was a natural and
simple thing, was it not? Even against my own will,
I am glad and even proud to do thy dear will. But for
another, out upon it!”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, my Gillette,” said the painter, falling
upon his knees; “I would rather be beloved than
famous. You are fairer than success and honors.
There, fling the pencils away, and burn these sketches!
I have made a mistake. I was meant to love and not
to paint. Perish art and all its secrets!”</p>

<p>Gillette looked admiringly at him, in an ecstasy of
happiness! She was triumphant; she felt instinctively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1033">[Pg 1033]</span>
that art was laid aside for her sake, and flung like a
grain of incense at her feet.</p>

<p>“Yet he is only an old man,” Poussin continued;
“for him you would be a woman, and nothing more.
You—so perfect!”</p>

<p>“I must love you indeed!” she cried, ready to sacrifice
even love’s scruples to the lover who had given
up so much for her sake; “but I should bring about
my own ruin. Ah! to ruin myself, to lose everything
for you!... It is a very glorious thought! Ah! but
you will forget me. Oh! what evil thought is this that
has come to you?”</p>

<p>“I love you, and yet I thought of it,” he said, with
something like remorse. “Am I so base a wretch?”</p>

<p>“Let us consult Père Hardouin,” she said.</p>

<p>“No, no! Let it be a secret between us.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I will do it. But you must not be
there,” she said. “Stay at the door with your dagger
in your hand; and if I call, rush in and kill the
painter.”</p>

<p>Poussin forgot everything but art. He held Gillette
tightly in his arms.</p>

<p>“He loves me no longer!” thought Gillette when she
was alone. She repented of her resolution already.</p>

<p>But to these misgivings there soon succeeded a
sharper pain, and she strove to banish a hideous
thought that arose in her own heart. It seemed to her
that her own love had grown less already, with a
vague suspicion that the painter had fallen somewhat
in her eyes.</p>

<h3>II<br>
<em>CATHERINE LESCAULT</em></h3>

<p>Three months after Poussin and Porbus met, the
latter went to see Master Frenhofer. The old man
had fallen a victim to one of those profound and spontaneous
fits of discouragement that are caused, according
to medical logicians, by indigestion, flatulence,
fever, or enlargement of the spleen; or, if you take
the opinion of the Spiritualists, by the imperfections
of our mortal nature. The good man had simply overworked
himself in putting the finishing touches to his
mysterious picture. He was lounging in a huge carved
oak chair, covered with black leather, and did not
change his listless attitude, but glanced at Porbus like
a man who has settled down into low spirits.</p>

<p>“Well, master,” said Porbus, “was the ultramarine
bad that you sent for to Bruges? Is the new white
difficult to grind? Is the oil poor, or are the brushes
recalcitrant?”</p>

<p>“Alas!” cried the old man, “for a moment I thought
that my work was finished, but I am sure that I am
mistaken in certain details, and I can not rest until I
have cleared my doubts. I am thinking of traveling.
I am going to Turkey, to Greece, to Asia, in quest of
a model, so as to compare my picture with the different
living forms of Nature. Perhaps,” and a smile of
contentment stole over his face, “perhaps I have Nature
herself up there. At times I am half afraid that
a breath may waken her, and that she will escape me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1035">[Pg 1035]</span></p>

<p>He rose to his feet as if to set out at once.</p>

<p>“Aha!” said Porbus, “I have come just in time to
save you the trouble and expense of a journey.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Frenhofer in amazement.</p>

<p>“Young Poussin is loved by a woman of incomparable
and flawless beauty. But, dear master, if he consents
to lend her to you, at the least you ought to let
us see your work.”</p>

<p>The old man stood motionless and completely dazed.</p>

<p>“What!” he cried piteously at last, “show you my
creation, my bride? Rend the veil that has kept my
happiness sacred? It would be an infamous profanation.
For ten years I have lived with her; she is mine,
mine alone; she loves me. Has she not smiled at me,
at each stroke of the brush upon the canvas? She has
a soul—the soul that I have given her. She would
blush if any eyes but mine should rest on her. To
exhibit her! Where is the husband, the lover so vile
as to bring the woman he loves to dishonor? When
you paint a picture for the court, you do not put your
whole soul into it; to courtiers you sell lay figures
duly colored. My painting is no painting, it is a sentiment,
a passion. She was born in my studio, there
she must dwell in maiden solitude, and only when clad
can she issue thence. Poetry and women only lay the
last veil aside for their lovers. Have we Rafael’s
model, Ariosto’s Angelica, Dante’s Beatrice? Nay,
only their form and semblance. But this picture,
locked away above in my studio, is an exception in
our art. It is not a canvas, it is a woman—a woman
with whom I talk. I share her thoughts, her tears,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1036">[Pg 1036]</span>
her laughter. Would you have me fling aside these
ten years of happiness like a cloak? Would you have
me cease at once to be father, lover, and creator? She
is not a creature, but a creation.</p>

<p>“Bring your young painter here. I will give him
my treasures; I will give him pictures by Correggio
and Michelangelo and Titian; I will kiss his footprints
in the dust; but make him my rival! Shame on
me. Ah! ah! I am a lover first, and then a painter.
Yes, with my latest sigh I could find strength to burn
my ‘Belle Noiseuse’; but—compel her to endure the
gaze of a stranger, a young man and a painter!—Ah!
no, no! I would kill him on the morrow who should
sully her with a glance! Nay, you, my friend, I would
kill you with my own hands in a moment if you did
not kneel in reverence before her! Now, will you
have me submit my idol to the careless eyes and
senseless criticisms of fools? Ah! love is a mystery;
it can only live hidden in the depths of the heart. You
say, even to your friend, ‘Behold her whom I love,’
and there is an end of love.”</p>

<p>The old man seemed to have grown young again;
there was light and life in his eyes, and a faint
flush of red in his pale face. His hands shook. Porbus
was so amazed by the passionate vehemence of
Frenhofer’s words that he knew not what to reply to
this utterance of an emotion as strange as it was profound.
Was Frenhofer sane or mad? Had he fallen
a victim to some freak of the artist’s fancy? or were
these ideas of his produced by the strange light-headedness
which comes over us during the long travail of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1037">[Pg 1037]</span>
a work of art. Would it be possible to come to terms
with this singular passion?</p>

<p>Harassed by all these doubts, Porbus spoke—“Is
it not woman for woman?” he said. “Does not Poussin
submit his mistress to your gaze?”</p>

<p>“What is she?” retorted the other. “A mistress
who will be false to him sooner or later. Mine will be
faithful to me forever.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Porbus, “let us say no more
about it. But you may die before you will find such
a flawless beauty as hers, even in Asia, and then your
picture will be left unfinished.</p>

<p>“Oh! it is finished,” said Frenhofer. “Standing
before it you would think that it was a living woman
lying on the velvet couch beneath the shadow of the
curtains. Perfumes are burning on a golden tripod
by her side. You would be tempted to lay your hand
upon the tassel of the cord that holds back the curtains;
it would seem to you that you saw her breast
rise and fall as she breathed; that you beheld the living
Catherine Lescault, the beautiful courtezan whom
men called ‘La Belle Noiseuse,’ And yet—if I could
but be sure—”</p>

<p>“Then go to Asia,” returned Porbus, noticing a
certain indecision in Frenhofer’s face. And with that
Porbus made a few steps toward the door.</p>

<p>By that time Gillette and Nicolas Poussin had
reached Frenhofer’s house. The girl drew away her
arm from her lover’s as she stood on the threshold,
and shrank back as if some presentiment flashed
through her mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1038">[Pg 1038]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! what have I come to do here?” she asked of
her lover in low vibrating tones, with her eyes fixed
on his.</p>

<p>“Gillette, I have left you to decide; I am ready to
obey you in everything. You are my conscience and
my glory. Go home again; I shall be happier, perhaps,
if you do not—”</p>

<p>“Am I my own when you speak to me like that?
No, no; I am like a child.—Come,” she added, seemingly
with a violent effort; “if our love dies, if I
plant a long regret in my heart, your fame will be
the reward of my obedience to your wishes, will it
not? Let us go in. I shall still live on as a memory
on your palette; that shall be life for me afterward.”</p>

<p>The door opened, and the two lovers encountered
Porbus, who was surprised by the beauty of Gillette,
whose eyes were full of tears. He hurried her, trembling
from head to foot, into the presence of the old
painter.</p>

<p>“Here!” he cried, “is she not worth all the masterpieces
in the world!”</p>

<p>Frenhofer trembled. There stood Gillette in the
artless and childlike attitude of some timid and innocent
Georgian, carried off by brigands, and confronted
with a slave merchant. A shamefaced red
flushed her face, her eyes drooped, her hands hung
by her side, her strength seemed to have failed her,
her tears protested against this outrage. Poussin
cursed himself in despair that he should have brought
his fair treasure from its hiding-place. The lover over,
came the artist, and countless doubts assailed Poussin’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1039">[Pg 1039]</span>
heart when he saw youth dawn in the old man’s eyes,
as, like a painter, he discerned every line of the form
hidden beneath the young girl’s vesture. Then the
lover’s savage jealousy awoke.</p>

<p>“Gillette!” he cried, “let us go.”</p>

<p>The girl turned joyously at the cry and the tone in
which it was uttered, raised her eyes to his, looked at
him, and fled to his arms.</p>

<p>“Ah! then you love me,” she cried; “you love me!”
and she burst into tears.</p>

<p>She had spirit enough to suffer in silence, but she
had no strength to hide her joy.</p>

<p>“Oh! leave her with me for one moment,” said the
old painter, “and you shall compare her with my
Catherine ... yes—I consent.”</p>

<p>Frenhofer’s words likewise came from him like a
lover’s cry. His vanity seemed to be engaged for his
semblance of womanhood; he anticipated the triumph
of the beauty of his own creation over the beauty of
the living girl.</p>

<p>“Do not give him time to change his mind!” cried
Porbus, striking Poussin on the shoulder. “The
flower of love soon fades, but the flower of art is
immortal.”</p>

<p>“Then am I only a woman now for him?” said
Gillette. She was watching Poussin and Porbus
closely.</p>

<p>She raised her head proudly; she glanced at Frenhofer,
and her eyes flashed; then as she saw how her
lover had fallen again to gazing at the portrait which
he had taken at first for a Giorgione—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1040">[Pg 1040]</span></p>

<p>“Ah!” she cried; “let us go up to the studio. He
never gave me such a look.”</p>

<p>The sound of her voice recalled Poussin from his
dreams.</p>

<p>“Old man,” he said, “do you see this blade? I will
plunge it into your heart at the first cry from this
young girl; I will set fire to your house, and no one
shall leave it alive. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>Nicolas Poussin scowled; every word was a
menace. Gillette took comfort from the young
painter’s bearing, and yet more from that gesture, and
almost forgave him for sacrificing her to his art and
his glorious future.</p>

<p>Porbus and Poussin stood at the door of the studio
and looked at each other in silence. At first the
painter of the Saint Mary of Egypt hazarded some
exclamations: “Ah! she has taken off her clothes; he
told her to come into the light—he is comparing the
two!” but the sight of the deep distress in Poussin’s
face suddenly silenced him; and though old painters
no longer feel these scruples, so petty in the presence
of art, he admired them because they were so natural
and gracious in the lover. The young man kept his
hand on the hilt of his dagger, and his ear was
almost glued to the door. The two men standing
in the shadow might have been conspirators waiting
for the hour when they might strike down a
tyrant.</p>

<p>“Come in, come in,” cried the old man. He was
radiant with delight. “My work is perfect. I can
show her now with pride. Never shall painter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1041">[Pg 1041]</span>
brushes, colors, light, and canvas produce a rival for
‘Catherine Lescault,’ the beautiful courtezan!”</p>

<p>Porbus and Poussin, burning with eager curiosity,
hurried into a vast studio. Everything was in disorder
and covered with dust, but they saw a few
pictures here and there upon the wall. They stopped
first of all in admiration before the life-size figure of
a woman partially draped.</p>

<p>“Oh! never mind that,” said Frenhofer; “that is a
rough daub that I made, a study, a pose, it is nothing.
These are my failures,” he went on, indicating the
enchanting compositions upon the walls of the studio.</p>

<p>This scorn for such works of art struck Porbus and
Poussin dumb with amazement. They looked round
for the picture of which he had spoken, and could not
discover it.</p>

<p>“Look here!” said the old man. His hair was disordered,
his face aglow with a more than human exaltation,
his eyes glittered, he breathed hard like a
young lover frenzied by love.</p>

<p>“Aha!” he cried, “you did not expect to see such
perfection! You are looking for a picture, and you
see a woman before you. There is such depth in that
canvas, the atmosphere is so true that you can not
distinguish it from the air that surrounds us. Where
is art? Art has vanished, it is invisible! It is the
form of a living girl that you see before you. Have
I not caught the very hues of life, the spirit of the
living line that defines the figure? Is there not the
effect produced there like that which all natural objects
present in the atmosphere about them, or fishes in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1042">[Pg 1042]</span>
water? Do you see how the figure stands out against
the background? Does it not seem to you that you
pass your hand along the back? But then for seven
years I studied and watched how the daylight blends
with the objects on which it falls. And the hair, the
light pours over it like a flood, does it not?...
Ah! she breathed, I am sure that she breathed! Her
breast—ah, see! Who would not fall on his knees
before her? Her pulses throb. She will rise to her
feet. Wait!”</p>

<p>“Do you see anything?” Poussin asked of Porbus.</p>

<p>“No ... do you?”</p>

<p>“I see nothing.”</p>

<p>The two painters left the old man to his ecstasy, and
tried to ascertain whether the light that fell full upon
the canvas had in some way neutralized all the effect
for them. They moved to the right and left of the
picture; they came in front, bending down and standing
upright by turns.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, it is really canvas,” said Frenhofer, who
mistook the nature of this minute investigation.</p>

<p>“Look! the canvas is on a stretcher, here is the
easel; indeed, here are my colors, my brushes,” and he
took up a brush and held it out to them, all unsuspicious
of their thought.</p>

<p>“The old <em>lansquenet</em> is laughing at us,” said Poussin,
coming once more toward the supposed picture.
“I can see nothing there but confused masses of color
and a multitude of fantastical lines that go to make a
dead wall of paint.”</p>

<p>“We are mistaken, look!” said Porbus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1043">[Pg 1043]</span></p>

<p>In a corner of the canvas, as they came nearer, they
distinguished a bare foot emerging from the chaos of
color, half-tints and vague shadows that made up a
dim, formless fog. Its living delicate beauty held
them spellbound. This fragment that had escaped
an incomprehensible, slow, and gradual destruction
seemed to them like the Parian marble torso of
some Venus emerging from the ashes of a ruined
town.</p>

<p>“There is a woman beneath,” exclaimed Porbus,
calling Poussin’s attention to the coats of paint with
which the old artist had overlaid and concealed his
work in the quest of perfection.</p>

<p>Both artists turned involuntarily to Frenhofer.
They began to have some understanding, vague
though it was, of the ecstasy in which he lived.</p>

<p>“He believes it in all good faith,” said Porbus.</p>

<p>“Yes, my friend,” said the old man, rousing himself
from his dreams, “it needs faith, faith in art, and
you must live for long with your work to produce
such a creation. What toil some of those shadows
have cost me. Look! there is a faint shadow there
upon the cheek beneath the eyes—if you saw that on
a human face, it would seem to you that you could
never render it with paint. Do you think that that
effect has not cost unheard-of toil?</p>

<p>“But not only so, dear Porbus. Look closely at
my work, and you will understand more clearly what
I was saying as to methods of modeling and outline.
Look at the high lights on the bosom, and see how by
touch on touch, thickly laid on, I have raised the surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1044">[Pg 1044]</span>
so that it catches the light itself and blends it
with the lustrous whiteness of the high lights, and
how by an opposite process, by flattening the surface
of the paint, and leaving no trace of the passage of
the brush, I have succeeded in softening the contours
of my figures and enveloping them in half-tints until
the very idea of drawing, of the means by which the
effect is produced, fades away, and the picture has
the roundness and relief of nature. Come closer.
You will see the manner of working better; at a little
distance it can not be seen. There! Just there, it is,
I think, very plainly to be seen,” and with the tip of
his brush he pointed out a patch of transparent color
to the two painters.</p>

<p>Porbus, laying a hand on the old artist’s shoulder,
turned to Poussin with a “Do you know that in him
we see a very great painter?”</p>

<p>“He is even more of a poet than a painter,” Poussin
answered gravely.</p>

<p>“There,” Porbus continued, as he touched the canvas,
“lies the utmost limit of our art on earth.”</p>

<p>“Beyond that point it loses itself in the skies,” said
Poussin.</p>

<p>“What joys lie there on this piece of canvas!” exclaimed
Porbus.</p>

<p>The old man, deep in his own musings, smiled at
the woman he alone beheld, and did not hear.</p>

<p>“But sooner or later he will find out that there is
nothing there!” cried Poussin.</p>

<p>“Nothing on my canvas!” said Frenhofer, looking
in turn at either painter and at his picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1045">[Pg 1045]</span></p>

<p>“What have you done?” muttered Porbus, turning
to Poussin.</p>

<p>The old man clutched the young painter’s arm and
said, “Do you see nothing? clodpate! Huguenot! varlet!
cullion! What brought you here into my studio?—My
good Porbus,” he went on, as he turned to the
painter, “are you also making a fool of me? Answer!
I am your friend. Tell me, have I ruined my picture
after all?”</p>

<p>Porbus hesitated and said nothing, but there was
such intolerable anxiety in the old man’s white face
that he pointed to the easel.</p>

<p>“Look!” he said.</p>

<p>Frenhofer looked for a moment at his picture, and
staggered back.</p>

<p>“Nothing! nothing! After ten years of work....”
He sat down and wept.</p>

<p>“So I am a dotard, a madman, I have neither talent
nor power! I am only a rich man, who works for his
own pleasure, and makes no progress. I have done
nothing after all!”</p>

<p>He looked through his tears at his picture. Suddenly
he rose and stood proudly before the two
painters.</p>

<p>“By the body and blood of Christ,” he cried with
flashing eyes, “you are jealous! You would have me
think that my picture is a failure because you want
to steal her from me! Ah! I see her, I see her,” he
cried “she is marvelously beautiful....”</p>

<p>At that moment Poussin heard the sound of weeping;
Gillette was crouching forgotten in a corner. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1046">[Pg 1046]</span>
at once the painter once more became the lover.
“What is it, my angel?” he asked her.</p>

<p>“Kill me!” she sobbed. “I must be a vile thing
if I love you still, for I despise you.... I admire
you, and I hate you! I love you, and I feel that I
hate you even now!”</p>

<p>While Gillette’s words sounded in Poussin’s ears,
Frenhofer drew a green serge covering over his
“Catherine” with the sober deliberation of a jeweler
who locks his drawers when he suspects his visitors
to be expert thieves. He gave the two painters a profoundly
astute glance that expressed to the full his
suspicions and his contempt for them, saw them out
of his studio with impetuous haste and in silence, until
from the threshold of his house he bade them “Good-by,
my young friends!”</p>

<p>That farewell struck a chill of dread into the two
painters. Porbus, in anxiety, went again on the morrow
to see Frenhofer, and learned that he had died
in the night after burning his canvases.</p>

<p><em>Eugène Scribe was born in 1791, at Paris,
where he died in 1861. He soon tired of the
law as a profession and between 1820 and
1825 wrote farces and little comedies.</em></p>

<p><em>Then begins the second period of his career,
during which he wrote the librettos, masterpieces
themselves, of the familiar operas, “La
Dame Blanche,” “Robert Le Diable,” “Les
Huguenots,” “Fra Diavolo,” etc., and the serious
comedy “Valerie,” in which he shows a
most delightful and unique genius in prolonging
interestingly his situations. With “Bertrand
and Raton,” a five-act comedy, produced
at the Theatre Français in 1833, he commenced
a series of historical and political comedies.
In all, Scribe wrote some three hundred and
fifty pieces. In 1836 he was elected a member
of the Academy.</em></p>

<p><em>In style, Scribe is delicate and graceful,
with an indescribable “charm,” as in his first
manner, or lively and natural, as in his second;
but he is not to be relied upon for the

<p>Joseph, opening the door of the salon, came
to tell us that the post-chaise was ready. My
mother and my sister threw themselves into my
arms. “There is yet time,” said they. “It is not too
late. Give up this journey and remain with us.” I
replied: “My mother, I am a gentleman. I am twenty
years old, my country needs me, I must win fame and
renown; be it in the army, be it at court, I must be
heard of, men must speak of me.”</p>

<p>“And when you are far away, tell me, Bernard,
what will become of me, your old mother?”</p>

<p>“You will be happy and proud to hear of your son’s
successes—”</p>

<p>“And if you are killed in some battle?”</p>

<p>“What matters it? What is life? Only a dream.
One dreams only of glory at twenty, and when one
is a gentleman; but do not fear, you will see me return
to you in a few years, a colonel, a maréchal-de-camp,
or, better still, with a fine position at Versailles.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! When will that be?”</p>

<p>“It will come, and I shall be respected and envied
by all—and then—every one will take off his hat
to me—and then—I will marry my cousin Henriette,
and I will find good husbands for my sisters, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1050">[Pg 1050]</span>
shall all live together tranquil and happy on my estates
in Brittany.”</p>

<p>“Why not do all that to-day, my son? Has not
your father left you the finest fortune in the country?
Where is there, for ten leagues around, a richer domain,
or a more beautiful château than that of Roche-Bernard?
Are you not loved and respected by your vassals?
When you walk through the village, is there
a single one who fails to salute you and take off his
hat? Do not leave us, my son; remain here with your
friends, near your sisters, near your old mother, whom
perhaps you will not find here when you return. Do
not waste in search of vain glory or abridge by cares
and torments of all kinds the days which already go
so swiftly. Life is sweet, my child, and the sun of
Brittany is so bright!” So saying she led me to the
open window and pointed to the beautiful avenues of
my park; the grand old chestnut trees were in full
bloom, and the air was sweet with the fragrance of
the lilacs and the honeysuckles, whose leaves sparkled
in the sunlight.</p>

<p>All the house-servants awaited me in the anteroom.
They were so sad and quiet that they seemed to say
to me: “Do not go, young master, do not go.” Hortense,
my eldest sister, pressed me in her arms, and
my little sister Amélie, who was in one corner of the
room occupied in looking at some engravings in a volume
of La Fontaine, came to me, and, handing me the
book, cried: “Read, read, my brother!” It was the
fable of “The Two Pigeons.”</p>

<p>But I repulsed them all and said: “I am twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1051">[Pg 1051]</span>
years old. <em>Je suis gentilhomme.</em> I <em>must</em> in honor and
glory. Let me go.” And I hastened to the courtyard,
and got into the post-chaise, when a woman
appeared at the landing of the stairs. It was my
beautiful cousin Henriette! She did not weep, she
did not say a word—but, pale and trembling, she
could scarcely stand. She waved me an adieu with
her white handkerchief, then fell unconscious. I ran
to her, raised her, put my arms around her, and
swore to her eternal love; and the moment she recovered
consciousness, leaving her in my mother’s care,
I ran to the chaise, and, without turning my head,
drove away.</p>

<p>If I had looked at Henriette I might have wavered.
A few moments afterward we were rolling along the
grand route.</p>

<p>For a long while I thought of nothing but Henriette,
my mother, and my sisters, and all the happiness
I had left behind me; but these thoughts were
effaced in the measure that the towers of Roche-Bernard
faded from my view, and soon ambitious dreams
of glory spread over my spirit. What projects! What
<em>châteaux en Espagne</em>! What glorious deeds I performed
in that chaise! Riches, honors, dignities, rewards
of all kinds! I refused nothing. I merited
them, and I accepted all; at last, elevating myself as
I advanced on my journey, I was duke—governor of
a province—and no less a personage than a maréchal
of France when I arrived in the evening at my destination.
The voice of my valet, who addressed me
modestly as Monsieur le Chevalier, forced me to abdicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1052">[Pg 1052]</span>
for the time being, and I was obliged to return
to the earth and to myself.</p>

<p>The following day I continued my journey and
dreamed the same dreams, for the way was long. At
last we arrived at Sédan, where I expected to visit
the Duc de C——, an old friend of our family. He
would (I thought) surely take me with him to Paris,
where he was expected at the end of the month, and
then he would present me at Versailles, and obtain
for me, at the very least, a company of dragoons.</p>

<p>I arrived in Sédan in the evening—too late to
present myself at the château of my friend (which
was some distance from the city), so I delayed my
visit until the next day, and put up at the “Armes de
France,” the best hotel in the place.</p>

<p>I supped at the table d’hôte and asked the way to
take on the morrow to the château of the Duc de
C——.</p>

<p>“Any one can show you,” said a young officer who
sat near me, “for it is well known the whole country
round. It was in this château that died a great warrior,
a very celebrated man—Maréchal Fabert!” Then
the conversation fell, as was natural between young
military men, on the Maréchal Fabert. They spoke
of his battles, his exploits, of his modesty, which
caused him to refuse letters of nobility and the collar
of his order offered him by Louis XIV. Above all,
they marveled at the good fortune which comes to
some men. What inconceivable happiness for a simple
soldier to rise to the rank of maréchal of France—he,
a man of no family, the son of a printer! They could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1053">[Pg 1053]</span>
cite no other case similar to his, and the masses did
not hesitate to ascribe his elevation to supernatural
causes. It was said that he had employed magic from
his childhood, that he was a sorcerer, and that he had
a compact with the devil; and our old landlord, who
had all the credulity of our Breton peasants, swore
to us that in this château of the Duc de C——, where
Fabert died, there had frequently been seen a black
man whom no one knew; and that the servants had
seen him enter Fabert’s chamber and disappear, carrying
with him the soul of the maréchal, which he had
bought some years before, and which, therefore, belonged
to him; and that even now, in the month of
May, on the anniversary of Fabert’s death, one can see
at night a black man bearing a light, which is Fabert’s
soul.</p>

<p>This story amused us at dessert, and we gaily
drank a bottle of champagne to the familiar demon
of Fabert, praying for his patronage, and help to gain
victories like those of Collioure and of La Marfée.</p>

<p>The next day I arose early and set out for the
château, which proved to be an immense Gothic manor
house, having nothing very remarkable about it. At
any other time I would not have viewed it with any
great interest; but now I gazed at it with feelings of
curiosity as I recalled the strange story told us by the
landlord of the “Armes de France.”</p>

<p>The door was opened by an old valet, and when I
told him I wished to see the Duc de C——, he replied
that he did not know whether his master was visible
or not or if he would receive me. I gave him my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1054">[Pg 1054]</span>
name and he went away, leaving me alone in a very
large and gloomy hall, decorated with trophies of the
chase and family portraits. I waited some time, but
he did not return. The silence was almost oppressive;
I began to grow impatient and had already counted
two or three times all the family portraits, and all the
beams in the ceiling, when I heard a noise in the
wainscot.</p>

<p>It was a door which the wind had blown open. I
looked up, and perceived a very pretty boudoir lighted
by two great casements and a glass door which opened
on a magnificent park. I advanced a few steps into
the apartment, and paused suddenly at a strange
spectacle. A man (his back was turned to the door
through which I had entered) was lying on a couch.
He arose, and, without perceiving me, ran quickly to
the window. Tears rolled down his cheeks and profound
despair was imprinted on his features. He
remained some time immovable, his head resting on
his hands, then he commenced to walk with great
strides across the room; turning, he saw me, stopped
suddenly, and trembled. As for myself, I was horror-struck,
and dazed in consequence of my indiscretion.
I wished to retire, and murmured some incoherent
apologies.</p>

<p>“Who are you? What do you want?” said he, in
a deep voice, catching me by the arm.</p>

<p>I was very much frightened and embarrassed, but
replied: “I am the Chevalier Bernard de la Roche-Bernard,
and I have just arrived from Brittany.”</p>

<p>“I know! I know!” said he, and, throwing his arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1055">[Pg 1055]</span>
around me, he embraced me warmly, and leading me
to the couch made me sit near him, spoke to me rapidly
of my father and of all my family, whom he knew so
well that I concluded that it was the master of the
château.</p>

<p>“You are Monsieur de C——, are you not?” asked
I. He arose, looked at me with a strange glance, and
replied: “I was, but I am no longer. I am no longer
anybody.” Then seeing my astonishment he said:
“Not a word, young man, do not question me.”</p>

<p>I replied, blushing: “If, Monsieur, I have witnessed,
without wishing it, your chagrin and your sorrow,
perhaps my devotion and my friendship can assuage
your grief?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, you are right; not that you can change
my condition, but you can receive, at least, my last
wishes and my last vows. It is the only service that
I ask of you.”</p>

<p>He crossed the room, closed the door, then came
and sat down beside me, who, agitated and trembling,
awaited his words. They were somewhat grave and
solemn, and his physiognomy, above all, had an expression
that I had never before seen. His lofty
brow, which I examined attentively, seemed marked
by fate. His complexion was very pale, and his eyes
were black, bright, and piercing: and from time to
time his features, altered by suffering, contracted
under an ironical and infernal smile.</p>

<p>“That which I am about to relate to you,” said he,
“will confound your reason; you will doubt, you will
not believe me, perhaps; even I often doubt still. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1056">[Pg 1056]</span>
tell myself it can not be; but the proofs are too real;
and are there not in all that surrounds us, in our organization
even, many other mysteries that we are obliged
to submit to, without being able to comprehend?” He
paused a moment, as if to gather together his thoughts,
passed his hand over his brow, and continued: “I was
born in this château. I had two elder brothers, to
whom fell the wealth and honors of our house. I had
nothing to expect, nothing to look forward to but an
abbé’s mantle; nevertheless, ambitious dreams of glory
and power fermented in my head and made my heart
throb with anticipation. Miserable in my obscurity,
eager for renown, I thought only of means to acquire
it at any price, and these ideas made me insensible to
all the pleasures and all the sweetness of life. To me
the present was nothing; I only existed for the future,
and this future presented itself to me under a most
sombre aspect. I reached my thirtieth year without
having accomplished anything;—then there arose in
the capital literary lights whose brilliance penetrated
even to our remote province. Ah! thought I, if I
could at least make for myself a name in the world
of letters, that might bring renown, and therein lies
true happiness. I had for a confidant of my chagrins
an old servant, an aged negro, who had served in my
family many years before my birth; he was the oldest
person on the estate, or for miles around, for no one
could recall his first appearance, and the country
folk said that he had known the Maréchal Fabert,
was present at his death, and that he was an evil
spirit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1057">[Pg 1057]</span></p>

<p>At that name, I started with surprise; the unknown
paused and asked me the cause of my embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said I; but I could not help thinking
that the black man must be the one spoken of by the
old landlord of the “Armes de France” the previous
evening.</p>

<p>M. de C—— continued:</p>

<p>“One day in Yago’s presence (that was the old
negro’s name) I gave way to my feelings, bemoaned
my obscurity, and bewailed my useless and monotonous
life, and I cried aloud in my despair: ‘I would
willingly give ten years of my life to be placed in the
first rank of our authors!’</p>

<p>“‘Ten years,’ said Yago, coolly; ‘that is much, it
is paying very dear for so little a thing; no matter, I
accept your ten years; remember your promise, I will
surely keep mine.’</p>

<p>“I can not describe to you my great surprise on
hearing him speak thus. I believed that his mind had
become enfeebled by the weight of years. I shrugged
my shoulders and smiled, and took no further notice
of him. Some days afterward I left home for Paris.
There I found myself launched into the society of men
of letters; their example encouraged and stimulated
me, and I soon published several works that were very
successful, which I will not now describe. All Paris
rushed to see me, the journals were filled with my
praises. The new name I had taken became celebrated,
and even recently, young man, you have
admired my works.”</p>

<p>Here another gesture of surprise on my part interrupted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1058">[Pg 1058]</span>
this recital. “Then you are not the Duc de
C——?” cried I.</p>

<p>“No,” replied he, coldly. And I asked myself: “A
celebrated man of letters! Is this Marmontel? is it
D’Alembert? is it Voltaire?”</p>

<p>The unknown sighed, a smile of regret and contempt
spread over his lips, and he continued his
recital.</p>

<p>“This literary reputation, which had seemed to me
so desirable, soon failed to satisfy a soul so ardent as
mine. I aspired to still higher successes, and I said
to Yago (who had followed me to Paris and who
kept close watch over me): ‘This is not real glory,
there is no veritable renown but that which one
acquires in the career of arms. What is an author,
a poet? Nothing! Give me a great general, or a
captain in the army! Behold the destiny that I desire,
and for a great military reputation I would willingly
give ten more years of my life.’</p>

<p>“‘I accept them,’ replied Yago, quickly. ‘I take
them—they belong to me—do not forget it.’”</p>

<p>At this stage of his recital the unknown paused once
more on seeing the alarm and incredulity that were
depicted on my features.</p>

<p>“You remember, I warned you, young man,” said
he, “that you could not believe my story. It must
seem to you a dream, a chimera—to me also;—nevertheless
the promotions, the honors that I soon obtained,
were no illusions. Those brave soldiers that I led into
the thickest of the fight! Those brilliant charges!
Those captured flags! Those victories which all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1059">[Pg 1059]</span>
France heard of; all that was <em>my</em> work—all that
glory belonged to me!”</p>

<p>While he marched up and down the room with
great strides, and spoke thus with warmth and with
enthusiasm, astonishment and fear had almost paralyzed
my senses. “Who then is this person?” thought
I. “Is it Coligny? is it Richelieu? is it the Maréchal
de Saxe?”</p>

<p>From his state of exaltation my unknown had fallen
again into deepest dejection, and, approaching me,
said with a sombre air: “Yago kept his promise; and
when, later on, disgusted with the vain smoke of military
glory, I aspired to that which is only real and
positive in this world—when at the price of five or six
years of existence I desired great riches, he gladly
gave them to me. Yes, young man, I have possessed
vast wealth, far beyond my wildest dreams—estates,
forests, and châteaux. To-day, still, all this is mine,
and in my power; if you doubt me—if you doubt the
existence of Yago—wait here, he is coming, and you
can see for yourself that which would confound your
reason and mine were it not unfortunately too real.”</p>

<p>The unknown approached the fireplace, looked at
the timepiece, made a gesture of alarm, and said to
me in a deep voice:</p>

<p>“This morning at daybreak I felt myself so weak
and so feeble that I could scarcely rise. I rang for
my <em>valet-de-chambre</em>; it was Yago who appeared.
‘What is this strange feeling?’ asked I.</p>

<p>“‘Master, nothing but what is perfectly natural.
The hour approaches, the moment arrives.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1060">[Pg 1060]</span></p>

<p>“‘And what is it?’ cried I.</p>

<p>“‘Can you not divine it? Heaven has destined you
sixty years to live; you were thirty when I began to
obey you.’</p>

<p>“‘Yago!’ cried I in affright, ‘do you speak seriously?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, master; in five years you have spent in
glory twenty-five years of life. You have sold them
to me. They belong to me; and these years that you
have voluntarily given up are now added to mine.’</p>

<p>“‘What! That, then, was the price of your services?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, and many others—for ages past—have paid
more dearly; for instance, Fabert, whom I protected
also.’</p>

<p>“‘Be silent, be silent!’ cried I; ‘this is not possible;
it can not be true!’</p>

<p>“‘As you please; but prepare yourself; for there
only remains for you a brief half-hour of life.’</p>

<p>“‘You are mocking me!’</p>

<p>“‘Not, at all. Calculate for yourself. Thirty-five
years you have had, and twenty-five years you have
sold to me—total, sixty. It is your own count; each
one takes his own.’ Then he wished to go away, and
I felt my strength diminish. I felt my life leaving me.</p>

<p>“‘Yago! Yago!’ I cried feebly; ‘give me a few
hours, a few hours more!’</p>

<p>“‘No, no,’ replied he, ‘it would be taking away
from myself, and I know better than you the value
of life. There is no treasure worth two hours of
existence.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1061">[Pg 1061]</span></p>

<p>“I could scarcely speak; my eyes were set in my
head, and the chill of death congealed the blood in my
veins. ‘Very well!’ said I with an effort, ‘take back
your gifts, for that which I have sacrificed all. Four
hours more and I renounce my gold, my wealth—all
this opulence that I have so much desired.’</p>

<p>“‘Be it so; you have been a good master, and I am
willing to do something for you. I consent.’</p>

<p>“I felt my strength come back, and I cried: ‘Four
hours—that is very little! Yago! Yago! Four hours
more and I renounce all my literary fame, all my
works that have placed me so high in the world’s
esteem.’</p>

<p>“‘Four hours for that!’ cried the negro with disdain;
‘it is too much. No matter. I can not refuse
your last request.’</p>

<p>“‘Not the last!’ cried I, clasping my hands before
him. ‘Yago! Yago! I supplicate you, give me until
this evening. The twelve hours, the entire day, and
all my exploits, my victories, all my military renown
may all be effaced from the memory of men. This
day, Yago, dear Yago; this whole day, and I will be
content!’</p>

<p>“‘You abuse my kindness,’ said he; ‘no matter, I
will give you until sunset; after that you must not ask
me. This evening, then, I will come for you’—and he
is gone,” continued the unknown, in despairing accents
“and this day, in which I see you for the first time,
is my last on earth.” Then going to the glass door,
which was open, and which led to the park, he cried:
“Alas! I will no longer behold the beautiful sky,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1062">[Pg 1062]</span>
these green lawns, the sparkling fountains! I will
never again breathe the balmy air of springtime. Fool
that I have been! These gifts that God has given to
all of us; these blessings, to which I was insensible,
and of which I can only now, when it is too late, appreciate
and comprehend the sweetness—and I might
have enjoyed them for twenty-five years more!—and
I have used up my life! I have sacrificed it for what?
For a vain and sterile glory, which has not made me
happy, and which dies with me! Look!” said he to
me, pointing to some peasants who traversed the park,
singing on their way to work. “What would I not
give now to share their labors and their poverty! But
I have no longer anything to give, or to hope for here
below, not even misfortune!”</p>

<p>Just then a ray of sunlight (the sun of the month
of May) shone through the casement and lit up his
pale and distracted features. He seized my arm in
a sort of delirium, and said to me: “See! see there!
is it not beautiful? the sun!—and I must leave all
this! Ah! at least I am still alive! I will have this
whole day—so pure, so bright, so radiant—this day
which for me has no morrow!” he then ran down the
steps of the open door, and bounded like a deer across
the park, and at a detour of the path he disappeared
in the shrubbery, before I hardly realized that he was
gone, or could detain him. To tell the truth, I would
not have had the strength. I lay back on the couch,
stunned, dazed, and weak with the shock of all I had
heard. I arose and walked up and down the room,
to assure myself that I was awake, that I had not been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1063">[Pg 1063]</span>
under the influence of a dream. Just then the door
of the boudoir opened and a servant announced: “Here
is my master, the Duc de C——.”</p>

<p>A man of sixty years and of distinguished presence
advanced toward me, and, giving me his hand, apologized
for having made me wait so long.</p>

<p>“I was not in the château. I had gone to seek my
younger brother, the Comte de C——, who is ill.”</p>

<p>“And is he in danger?” interrupted I.</p>

<p>“No, monsieur. Thanks to heaven,” replied my
host; “but in his youth ambitious dreams of glory
exalted his imagination, and a serious illness that he
has had recently (and which he deemed fatal) has
upset his mind, and produced a sort of delirium and
mental aberration, by which he persuades himself always
that he has but one day to live. It is insanity.”</p>

<p>All was explained to me.</p>

<p>“Now,” continued the duke, “let us come to you,
young man, and see what can be done for your advancement.
We will depart at the end of the month
for Versailles. I will present you at court.”</p>

<p>I blushed and replied: “I appreciate your kindness,
Monsieur le Duc, and I thank you very much; but I
will not go to Versailles.”</p>

<p>“What! would you renounce the court and all the
advantages and promotions which certainly await you
there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur—”</p>

<p>“But do you realize that with my influence you
can rise rapidly, and that with a little assiduity and
patience you can become distinguished in ten years?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1064">[Pg 1064]</span></p>

<p>“Ten years lost!” I cried in terror.</p>

<p>“What!” replied he, astonished. “Ten years is not
much to pay for fortune, glory, and honors? Come,
come, my young friend. Come with me to Versailles.”</p>

<p>“No, Monsieur le Duc. I am determined to return
to Brittany, and I beg of you to receive my profound
gratitude, and that of my family.”</p>

<p>“What folly!” cried he.</p>

<p>And I, remembering what I had listened to, said:
“It is wisdom!”</p>

<p>The next day I was en route, and with what exquisite
delight did I behold my beautiful château of
Roche-Bernard, the grand old trees in my park, and
the bright sunshine of Brittany. I found again my
vassals, my mother, my sisters, my fiancée, and my
happiness, which I still retain, for one week later I
married Henriette.</p>

<p><em>In 1835, “in one of the most distinguished
books of modern literature,” as Edmund
Gosse says, De Vigny exemplified the illusion
of military glory in three episodes. The story
here given is the great scene in the third episode
which mocks the illusion of active glory.</em></p>

<p><em>Alfred de Vigny was born at Loches in
1799. In 1828 he resigned his commission in
the army, where he had been fighting and
writing since 1815, having already published
his masterly poem “Möise,” and the historical
novel “Cinq-Mars,” after the manner of Walter

<h2 class="nobreak">NAPOLEON AND POPE PIUS VII</h2>

<p>We were at Fontainebleau. The Pope had
just arrived. The Emperor had awaited
him with great impatience, as he desired
the Holy Father to crown him. Napoleon received
him in person, and they immediately entered the carriage—on
opposite sides, at the same time, apparently
with an entire neglect of etiquette, but this was only
in appearance, for the movement was thoroughly calculated.
It was so arranged that neither might seem
to yield precedence or to exact it from the other. The
ruse was characteristically Italian. They at once
drove toward the palace, where all kinds of rumors
were in circulation. I had left several officers in the
room which preceded that of the Emperor; and I was
quite alone in his apartment.</p>

<p>I was standing looking at a long table, which was
of Roman mosaic work, and which was absolutely
loaded, covered with heaps of papers. I had often
seen Napoleon enter, and submit the pile of documents
to a strange system of decision. He did not take the
letters either by hazard or in order; but when the number
irritated him, he swept them off the table with his
hand—striking right and left like a mower, until he
had reduced the number to six or seven, which he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1068">[Pg 1068]</span>opened. Such disdainful conduct had moved me singularly.
So many letters of distress and mourning
cast underfoot as if by an angry wind; so many useless
prayers of widows and orphans having no chance
except that of being spared by the consular hand; so
many groaning leaves, moistened by the tears of so
many families, trampled under his heel with as little
compunction as if they were corpses on a battlefield—all
these seemed to represent the fate of France. Although
the hand that acted so ruthlessly was strong,
it seemed always that such brutal strength was anything
but admirable, and it seemed wrong that so
much should be left to the caprice of such a man.
Moreover, had a little consideration been shown, Napoleon
would have had so many more buttresses for
his power and authority. I felt my heart rise against
the man—but feebly, like the heart of one who was his
slave. I thought of the letters which had been treated
with such cruel contempt; cries of anguish came from
the envelopes; and having read some of the petitions I
constituted myself judge between the man and those
who had sacrificed themselves so much for him, upon
whose necks he was going to fasten the yoke tighter
that very day. I was holding one of the papers in my
hand, when the beating of the drums informed me of
the arrival of Napoleon. Now you know that just as
one always sees the flash from a cannon before one
hears the report, one always saw him as he was heard
to be approaching; he was so active, and seemed to
have so little time. When he rode into the courtyard
of the palace, his attendants were scarcely able to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1069">[Pg 1069]</span>
up with him. The sentry had barely time to salute
before the Emperor had got down from his horse and
was hurrying up the staircase. This time he had left
the Pope in the carriage in order to be able to enter
the palace alone, and had galloped on ahead. I heard
the sound of his spurs at the same time as the drums.
I had only just time enough to throw myself into an
alcove where there was an old-fashioned high bedstead
which was used by no one, and which was, fortunately,
concealed by curtains.</p>

<p>The Emperor was in a state of great excitement,
and strode about the room as if waiting for some one
with great impatience. Having darted across the
room several times, he went to the window and began
to drum on the panes. A carriage rolled into the
court; he ceased beating a tattoo on the glass, and
stamped with his foot as if the sight which he saw in
the courtyard was anything but agreeable to him.
Then he tore across the room to the door, which he
opened for the Pope.</p>

<p>Pius VII entered unattended. Bonaparte hastily
closed the door after the old man with the care of a
jailer. I will confess that I was in a state of mortal
terror at being the third of the party. However, I
remained motionless, listening eagerly to every word
that was said.</p>

<p>The Pope was tall; his face was long, yellow, and
had traces of great suffering, but bore the imprint of a
goodness of soul and nobility of spirit which knew no
bounds. He had fine, big, black eyes, and his mouth
was sweetened by a smile which lent something spirituelle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1070">[Pg 1070]</span>
and vivacious to his countenance. It was a smile
in which one could detect nothing of the cunning of
the world, but which was full to overflowing of Christian
goodness. On his head he wore a skull cap, from
under which escaped locks of his silver-streaked hair.
A red velvet cloak hung negligently on his stooping
shoulders, and his robe dragged at his feet. He entered
slowly, with the calm and prudent step of an
aged man, sank down into one of the big Roman armchairs,
which were gilded and covered with eagles,
lowered his eyes, and waited to hear what the other
Italian had to say to him.</p>

<p>What a scene that was! I can see it still. It was
not the genius of the man which I noticed, but his
character. Bonaparte was not then as you knew him
afterward; he had not grown gross—he had not the
swollen face, the gouty legs, nor was he so ridiculously
stout as he afterward became. Unfortunately, in art
he is almost always represented by a sort of caricature,
so that he will not be handed down to posterity
as he really was. He was not ungainly then, but nervous
and supple, lithe and active, convulsive in some
of his gestures, in some gracious; his chest was flat
and narrow—in short, he looked just as I had seen him
at Malta.</p>

<p>He did not stop stalking round the room when the
Pope entered. He wandered round the chair of the
latter like a cautious hunter; then suddenly halting in
front of Pius, he resumed a conversation which had
been commenced in the carriage, and which he was evidently
anxious to continue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1071">[Pg 1071]</span></p>

<p>“I tell you again, Holy Father, I am not a free-thinker;
and I don’t agree with those who are forever
reasoning about religious matters. I assure you that
in spite of my old republicans I shall go to mass.”</p>

<p>The last words he threw bruskly, as it were, in the
Pope’s face—incense of flattery undisguised. Then
he suddenly stopped and examined the Pope’s countenance
to catch the result, which he seemed to expect to
be great. The old man lowered his eyes and rested
his hands on the heads of the eagles which formed the
arms of the chair. He seemed to have assumed the
attitude of a Roman statue purposely, as if wishing to
express: I resign myself to hearing all the profane
things that he may choose to say to me!</p>

<p>Bonaparte took a turn round the room, and round
the chair which was in the middle, and it was plain to
be seen that he was not satisfied either with himself
or with his adversary, and that he was reproaching
himself for having resumed the conversation so rashly.
So he began to talk more connectedly as he walked
round the room, all the time watching narrowly the
reflection of the pontiff’s face in the mirror, and also
eying him carefully in profile as he passed; but not
venturing to look him full in the face for fear of
appearing too anxious about the effect of his words.</p>

<p>“There is one thing that hurts me very much, Holy
Father,” said he, “and that is that you consent to the
coronation as you formerly consented to the Concordat—as
if you were compelled to do so, and not as of
free will. You sit there before me with the air of a
martyr, resigned to the will of heaven, and suffering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1072">[Pg 1072]</span>
for the sake of your conscience. But that is not the
fact. You are not a prisoner. You are as free as
the air.”</p>

<p>Pius VII smiled and looked his interlocutor in
the face. He realized that the despotic nature with
which he had to contend was not satisfied with
obedience unless one seemed willing, even anxious,
to obey.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued Bonaparte, “you are quite free.
You may return to Rome if you like. The road is
open and no one will stop you.”</p>

<p>Without uttering a word, the Pope sighed and raised
his hand and his eyes to heaven; then very slowly he
lowered his eyes and studied the cross on his bosom
attentively.</p>

<p>Bonaparte continued to walk round the room and to
talk to his captive, his voice becoming sweeter and
more wheedling.</p>

<p>“Holy Father, were it not for the reverence I have
for you I should be inclined to say that you are a little
ungrateful. You seem to ignore entirely the services
which France has rendered you. As far as I am able
to judge, the Council of Venice, which elected you
Pope, was influenced somewhat by my campaign in
Italy, as well as by a word which I spoke for you. I
was very much troubled at the time that Austria
treated you so badly. I believe that your Holiness
was obliged to return to Rome by sea for fear of passing
through Austrian territory.”</p>

<p>He stopped for the answer of his silent guest; Pius
VII made simply the slightest inclination of the head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1073">[Pg 1073]</span>
and remained plunged in a melancholy reverie which
seemed to prevent him from hearing Napoleon.</p>

<p>Bonaparte then pushed a chair near to that of the
Pope. I started, for in seeking the chair he had come
very near my hiding-place, he even brushed the curtains
which concealed me.</p>

<p>“It was as a Catholic really that I was so afflicted
about your vexations. I have never had much time
to study theology, it is true, but I maintain a great
faith in the Church. She has a wonderful vitality,
Holy Father, although Voltaire did you some little
harm, certainly. Now if you are only willing we can
do a great deal of work together in the future.”</p>

<p>He assumed a caressing, wheedling air of innocence.</p>

<p>“Really, I have tried to understand your motives,
but I can’t for the life of me see what objection you
can have to making Paris your seat. I’ll leave the
Tuileries to you if you like. You’ll find your room
waiting for you there. I scarcely ever go there myself.
Don’t you see, Father, it is the capital of the
world. I’ll do whatever you want me to; and really,
after all, I am not as bad as I am painted. If you’ll
leave war and politics to me you may do as you like
in ecclesiastical matters. In fact, I would be your
soldier. Now wouldn’t that be a grand arrangement?
We could hold our councils like Constantine and
Charlemagne—I would open and dissolve them; and
then I would put the keys of the world into your
hands, for as our Lord said: ‘I came with a sword,’
and I would keep the sword; I would only bring it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1074">[Pg 1074]</span>
to you for your blessing after each new success of
our arms.”</p>

<p>The Pope, who until then had remained as motionless
as an Egyptian statue, slowly raised his head,
smiled sadly, lifted his eyes to heaven, and said, after
a gentle sigh, as if he were confiding the thought to his
invisible guardian angel:</p>

<p>“Commediante!”</p>

<p>Napoleon leaped from his chair like a wounded tiger.
He was in one of his “yellow tempers.” At first he
stamped about without uttering a word, biting his
lips till the blood came. He no longer circled round
his prey cautiously, but walked from end to end of the
room with firm resounding steps, and clinking his
spurs noisily. The room shook; the curtains trembled
like trees at the approach of a storm; I thought that
something terrible would surely happen; my hair began
to bristle, and I put my hand to my head unwittingly.
I looked at the Pope. He did not stir, but
simply pressed the heads of the eagles with his hands.</p>

<p>The storm burst violently.</p>

<p>“Comedian! What? I, a comedian? Indeed, I’ll
play some comedies for you that will set you all
a-weeping like women and children! Comedian, forsooth!
You are mistaken if you think that you may
insult me with impunity. My theatre is the world;
the rôle that I play is the double one of master and
actor; I use all of you as comedians, popes, kings,
peoples, and the string by which I work you—<em>you</em> my
puppets—is fear. You would need to be a much
heavier man than you are, Signor Chiaramonti, to dare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1075">[Pg 1075]</span>
to applaud or hiss me. Do you know that if it be my
will you will become a simple <em>curé</em>? As for you and
your tiara, France would mock at you if I did not seem
to be serious in saluting you.</p>

<p>“Only four years ago nobody dared speak of Christ.
Had that state of things continued who would have
cared for the Pope, I should like to know? Comedian!
You gentlemen are a little too ready at getting
a foothold among us. And now you are dissatisfied
because I am not such a fool as to sign away the liberties
of France as did Louis XIV. But you had better
not sing to me in that tune. It is I who hold you
between my thumb and finger; it is I who can carry
you from north to south and then back again to the
north like so many marionettes; it is I who give you
some stability because you represent an old idea which
I wish to resuscitate; and you have not enough wit to
see that, and to act as if you were not aware of the
fact. Now I’ll speak to you frankly. Trouble your
head with your own affairs and don’t interfere in what
you don’t understand and with what doesn’t in the
least concern you. You seem to think that you are
necessary, you set yourselves up as if you were of
some weight, and you dress yourselves in women’s
clothes. But I’ll let you know that you don’t impose
on me with all that; and if you don’t change your
tactics very soon I’ll treat your robes as Charles XII
did that of the Grand Vizier—I’ll tear them with
my spur.”</p>

<p>Then he ceased. I scarcely dared breathe. I advanced
my head a little, not hearing his voice, to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1076">[Pg 1076]</span>
if the poor old priest was dead with fright. The same
absolutely calm attitude, the same calm expression on
his face. For the second time he raised his eyes to
heaven, again he sighed, and smiled bitterly as he
murmured:</p>

<p>“Tragediante!”</p>

<p>Bonaparte was at the farther end of the room, leaning
against a marble chimney which was as high as he
was tall. Like an arrow shot out of a bow, he rushed
straight at the old man; I thought he was going to
kill him as he sat. But he suddenly stopped short,
seized a Sèvres vase on which the Capitol was painted,
threw it on the hearth and ground it under his heels.
Then he remained terribly quiet.</p>

<p>I was relieved, for I felt that his reason had got the
better of his temper. He became sad, and when he
finally spoke in a deep voice, it was evident that in the
two words uttered by the Pope he had recognized his
true portrait.</p>

<p>“Miserable life!” he said. Then he fell into reverie,
and without speaking tore the brim of his hat. When
his voice again was heard he was talking to himself:</p>

<p>“It’s true. Tragedian or comedian, I am always
playing a part—all is costume and pose. How wearying
it all is, and how belittling! Pose! pose! always
pose! In one case full face, in another profile—but invariably
for effect. Always trying to appear what
others worship, so that I may deceive the fools, keeping
them between hope and fear. Dazzling them by
bulletins, by prestige. Master of all of them and not
knowing what to do with them. That’s the simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1077">[Pg 1077]</span>
truth after all. And to make myself so miserable
through it all! It really is too much. For,” continued
he, sitting down in an armchair and crossing
his legs, “it bores me to death, the whole farce. As
soon as I sit down I don’t know what to do with myself.
I can’t even hunt for three days in succession
at Fontainebleau with being weary of it. I must always
be moving and making others move. I speak
quite frankly. I have plans in my life which would
require the lives of forty emperors to carry out, and
I make new ones every morning and evening; my imagination
is always on the <em>qui vive</em>; but before I have
carried out two of them I shall be exhausted in body
and mind; for our poor lamp of life doesn’t burn long
enough. And I must confess that if I could carry them
out I should not find that the world was one whit
better than it is now; but it <em>would</em> be better though,
for it would be united. I am not a philosopher. I
don’t understand many theories. Life is too short to
stop. As soon as I have an idea I put it into execution.
Others will find reasons after me for praising
me if I succeed and for abusing me if I fail. Differences
of opinion are active—they abound in France—but
I keep them down while I am alive—afterward—Well,
no matter! It is my business to succeed, and
that I intend to do. Every day I make an Iliad by my
actions—every day.”</p>

<p>Thereupon he rose quickly. In that moment he was
lively and natural, and was not thinking of posing as
he afterward did in St. Helena; he did not strive to
make himself ideal or to pose for effect—he was himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1078">[Pg 1078]</span>
outside of himself. He went back to the Pope,
who had remained seated, and paced in front of him.
Getting warmed up, he spoke with a dash of irony, at
an incredible rate:</p>

<p>“Birth is everything. Those who come into the
world poor and neglected are always desperate. That
desperation turns to action or suicide according to
character. When they have courage to attempt something
as I have done, they raise the devil. But what
else is to be done? One must live. One must find
one’s place and make one’s mark. I have carried
everything before me like a cannon-ball—all the worse
for those who happened to be in my way. But what
else could I have done? Each man eats according to
his appetite, and I have an insatiable one. Do you
know, Holy Father, at Toulon I had not wherewithal
to buy myself a pair of epaulets, in place of which I
had a mother and I don’t know how many brothers
on my shoulders. They are all satisfactorily settled
at present. Josephine married me out of pity in spite
of her old notary, who objected that I owned nothing
but my cap and cape, and now we are going to crown
her. The old man was right, though, as to what I
possessed at that time. Imperial mantle! Crown!
what does all that mean? Is it mine? Costume!
Actor’s costume! I will put them on for an hour and
then I shall have had enough of them. Then I shall
don my officer’s uniform, and ‘To horse’; all my life
on horseback. I couldn’t pass a single day resting,
without being in danger of falling out of the chair. I
am to be envied? Eh?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1079">[Pg 1079]</span></p>

<p>“I repeat, Holy Father; there are only two classes
of men in the world: those who have and those who
gain.</p>

<p>“Those who are in the first class rest, the others are
restless. As I learnt that lesson at an early age and
to some purpose I shall go a long way. There are
only two men who have done anything before they
were forty years old; Cromwell and Jean-Jacques; if
you had given one a farm, and the other twelve hundred
francs and his servant, they would neither have
commanded nor preached nor written. There are
workmen in buildings, in colors, in forms, and in
phrases; I am a workman in battles. It’s my business.
At the age of thirty-five I have manufactured eighteen
of them, which are called ‘Victories.’ I must be paid
for my work. And a throne is certainly not extravagant
payment. Besides, I shall always go on working.
You will see that all dynasties will date from mine,
although I am a mere parvenu. I am elected as you
are, Holy Father—and drawn from the multitude.
On this point we can well shake hands.”</p>

<p>And, approaching the Pope, Napoleon held out his
hand. Pius took the hand which was offered to him,
but shook his head sadly, and I saw his fine eyes cloud
with tears.</p>

<p>Bonaparte cast a hurried glance at the tears which
he had wrung from the old Pope, and I surprised
even a rapid motion in the corners of his mouth much
resembling a smile of triumph. At that moment his
intensely powerful and overbearing nature seemed to
me less admirable than that of his saintly adversary;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1080">[Pg 1080]</span>
I blushed for all my past admiration of Napoleon; I
felt a sadness creep over me at the thought that the
grandest policy appears little when stained by tricks
of vanity. I saw that the emperor had gained his end
in the interview by having yielded nothing and by having
drawn a sign of weakness from the Pope. He had
wished to have the last word, and without uttering another
syllable, he left the room as abruptly as he had
entered. I could not see whether he saluted the Pope
or not, but I do not think he did.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CLAUDE GUEUX</h2>
</div>

<p class="center p2b big1">BY VICTOR HUGO</p>


<p>Claude Gueux was a poor workman, living
in Paris about eight years ago, with his mistress
and child. Although his education had
been neglected, and he could not even read, the man
was naturally clever and intelligent, and thought deeply
over matters. Winter came with its attendant miseries—want
of work, want of food, want of fuel. The
man, the woman, and the child were frozen and famished.
The man turned thief. I know not what he
stole. What signifies, as the result was the same? To
the woman and child it gave three days’ bread and
warmth; to the man, five years’ imprisonment. He
was taken to Clairvaux—the abbey now converted into
a prison, its cells into dungeons, and the altar itself
into a pillory. This is called progress.</p>

<p>Claude Gueux, the honest workman, who turned
thief from force of circumstances, had a countenance
which impressed you—a high forehead somewhat
lined with care, dark hair already streaked with gray,
deep-set eyes beaming with kindness, while the lower
part clearly indicated firmness mingled with self-respect.
He rarely spoke, yet there was a certain dignity
in the man which commanded respect and obedience.
A fine character, and we shall see what society made
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1084">[Pg 1084]</span></p>

<p>Over the prison workshop was an inspector, who
rarely forgot that he was the jailer also to his subordinates,
handing them the tools with one hand, and
casting chains upon them with the other. A tyrant,
never using even self-reasoning; with ideas against
which there was no appeal; hard rather than firm, at
times he could even be jocular—doubtless a good
father, a good husband, really not vicious, but <em>bad</em>.
He was one of those men who never can grasp a
fresh idea, who apparently fail to be moved by any
emotion; yet with hatred and rage in their hearts
look like blocks of wood, heated on the one side
but frozen on the other. This man’s chief characteristic
was obstinacy; and so proud was he of
this very stubbornness that he compared himself with
Napoleon—an optical delusion, like taking the mere
flicker of a candle for a star. When he had made up
his mind to a thing, however absurd, he would carry
out that absurd idea. How often it happens, that,
when a catastrophe occurs, if we inquire into the
cause we find it originated through the obstinacy of
one with little ability, but having full faith in his own
powers.</p>

<p>Such was the inspector of the prison workshop at
Clairvaux—a man of flint placed by society over
others, who hoped to strike sparks out of such material;
but a spark from a like source is apt to end in
a conflagration.</p>

<p>The inspector soon singled out Claude Gueux, who
had been numbered and placed in the workshop, and,
finding him clever, treated him well. Seeing Claude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1085">[Pg 1085]</span>
looking sad (for he was ever thinking of her he termed
his wife), and being in a good humor, by way of
pastime to console the prisoner he told him the woman
had become one of the unfortunate sisterhood, and had
been reduced to infamy; of the child nothing was
known.</p>

<p>After a time Claude had accustomed himself to
prison rule, and by his calmness of manner and a certain
amount of resolution clearly marked in his face,
he had acquired a great ascendency over his companions,
who so much admired him that they asked
his advice, and tried in all ways to imitate him. The
very expression in his eyes clearly indicated the man’s
character; besides, is not the eye the window of the
soul, and what other result could be anticipated than
that the intelligent spirit should lead men with few
ideas, who yield to the attraction as the metal does
to the lodestone? In less than three months Claude
was the virtual head of the workshop, and at times he
almost doubted whether he was king or prisoner, being
treated something like a captive pope, surrounded by
his cardinals.</p>

<p>Such popularity ever has its attendant hatred; and
though beloved by the prisoners, Claude was detested
by the jailers. To him two men’s rations would have
been scarcely sufficient. The inspector laughed at this,
as his own appetite was large; but what would be
mirth to a duke, to a prisoner would be a great misfortune.
When a free man, Claude Gueux could
earn his daily four-pound loaf and enjoy it; but as a
prisoner he daily worked, and for his labor received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1086">[Pg 1086]</span>
one pound and a half of bread and four ounces of
meat: it naturally followed that he was always hungry.</p>

<p>He had just finished his meagre fare, and was about
to resume his labors, hoping in work to forget famine,
when a weakly looking young man came toward him,
holding a knife and his untasted rations in his hand,
but seemingly afraid to address him.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” said Claude, roughly.</p>

<p>“A favor at your hands,” timidly replied the young
man.</p>

<p>“What is it?” said Claude.</p>

<p>“Help me with my rations; I have more than I
can eat.”</p>

<p>For a moment Claude was taken aback, but without
further ceremony he divided the food in two and at
once partook of one-half.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the young man; “allow me to
share my rations with you every day.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?” said Claude.</p>

<p>“Albin.”</p>

<p>“Why are you here?” added Claude.</p>

<p>“I robbed.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” said Claude.</p>

<p>The same scene took place daily between this man
old before his time (he was only thirty-six) and the
boy of twenty, who looked at the most seventeen. The
feeling was more like that of father and son than
one brother to another; everything created a bond of
union between them—the very toil they endured together,
the fact of sleeping in the same quarters and
taking exercise in the same courtyard. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1087">[Pg 1087]</span>
happy, for were they not all the world to each other?
The inspector of the workshop was so hated by the
prisoners that he often had recourse to Claude Gueux
to enforce his authority; and when a tumult was on
the point of breaking out, a few words from Claude
had more effect than the authority of ten wardens.
Although the inspector was glad to avail himself of
this influence, he was jealous all the same, and hated
the superior prisoner with an envious and implacable
feeling—an example of might over right, all the more
fearful as it was secretly nourished. But Claude
cared so much for Albin that he thought little about
the inspector.</p>

<p>One morning as the warders were going their
rounds one of them summoned Albin, who was working
with Claude, to go before the inspector.</p>

<p>“What are you wanted for?” said Claude.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” replied Albin, following the
warder.</p>

<p>All day Claude looked in vain for his companion,
and at night, finding him still absent, he broke through
his ordinary reserve and addressed the turnkey. “Is
Albin ill?” said he.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the man.</p>

<p>“How is it that he has never put in an appearance
to-day?”</p>

<p>“His quarters have been changed,” was the reply.</p>

<p>For a moment Claude trembled, then calmly continued,
“Who gave the order?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur D——.” This was the inspector’s name.</p>

<p>On the following night the inspector, Monsieur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1088">[Pg 1088]</span>
D——, went his rounds as usual. Claude, who had
perceived him from the distance, rose, and hastened to
raise his woolen cap and button his gray woolen vest
to the throat—considered a mark of respect to superiors
in prison discipline.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Claude, as the inspector was about to
pass him, “has Albin really been quartered elsewhere?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the inspector.</p>

<p>“Sir, I can not live without him. You know the
rations are insufficient for me, and Albin divided his
portion with me. Could you not manage to let him
resume his old place near me?”</p>

<p>“Impossible; the order can not be revoked.”</p>

<p>“By whom was it given?”</p>

<p>“By me.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur D——,” replied Claude, “on you my
life depends.”</p>

<p>“I never cancel an order once given.”</p>

<p>“Sir, what have I ever done to you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” cried Claude, “separate me from
Albin?”</p>

<p>“Because I do,” replied the inspector, and with that
he passed on.</p>

<p>Claude’s head sank down, like the poor caged lion
deprived of his dog; but the grief, though so deeply
felt, in no way changed his appetite—he was famished.
Many offered to share their rations with him, but he
steadily refused, and continued his usual routine in
silence—breaking it only to ask the inspector daily, in
tones of anguish mingled with rage, something between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1089">[Pg 1089]</span>
a prayer and a threat, these two words: “And
Albin?”</p>

<p>The inspector simply passed on, shrugging his
shoulders; but had he only observed Claude he would
have seen the evident change, noticeable to all present,
and he would have heard these words, spoken respectfully
but firmly:</p>

<p>“Sir, listen to me; send my companion to me. It
would be wise to do so, I can assure you. Remember
my words!”</p>

<p>On Sunday he had sat for hours in the courtyard,
with his head bowed in his hands, and when a prisoner
called Faillette came up laughing, Claude said: “I am
judging some one.”</p>

<p>On the 25th of October, 1831, as the inspector went
his rounds, Claude, to draw his attention, smashed a
watch-glass he had found in the passage. This had
the desired effect.</p>

<p>“It was I,” said Claude. “Sir, restore my comrade
to me.”</p>

<p>“Impossible,” was the answer.</p>

<p>Looking the inspector full in the face, Claude firmly
added: “Now, reflect! To-day is the 25th of October;
I give you till the 4th of November.”</p>

<p>A warder remarked that Claude was threatening
Monsieur D——, and ought at once to be
locked up.</p>

<p>“No, it is not a case of blackhole,” replied the inspector
smiling disdainfully; “we must be considerate
with people of this stamp.”</p>

<p>The following day Claude was again accosted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1090">[Pg 1090]</span>
one of the prisoners named Pernot, as he was brooding
in the courtyard.</p>

<p>“Well, Claude, you are sad indeed; what are you
pondering over?”</p>

<p>“I fear some evil threatens that good Monsieur
D——.” answered Claude.</p>

<p>Claude daily impressed the fact on the inspector
how much Albin’s absence affected him, but with no
result save four-and-twenty hours’ solitary confinement.</p>

<p>On the 4th of November he looked round his
cell for the little that remained to remind him of his
former life. A pair of scissors, and an old volume of
the “Émile,” belonging to the woman he had loved
so well, the mother of his child—how useless to a man
who could neither work nor read!</p>

<p>As Claude walked down the old cloisters, so dishonored
by its new inmates and its fresh whitewashed
walls, he noticed how earnestly the convict Ferrari
was looking at the heavy iron bars that crossed the
window, and he said to him: “To-night I will cut
through these bars with these scissors,” pointing to the
pair he still held in his hand.</p>

<p>Ferrari laughed incredulously, and Claude joined in
the mirth. During the day he worked with more than
ordinary ardor, wishing to finish a straw hat, which
he had been paid for in advance by a tradesman at
Troyes—M. Bressier.</p>

<p>Shortly before noon he made some excuse to go
down into the carpenters’ quarters, a story below his
own, at the time the warders were absent. Claude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1091">[Pg 1091]</span>
received a hearty welcome, as he was equally popular
here as elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Can any one lend me an ax?” he said.</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>Without exacting any promises of secrecy he at
once replied: “To kill the inspector with to-night.”</p>

<p>Claude was at once offered several; choosing the
smallest, he hid it beneath his waistcoat and left.
Now, there were twenty-seven prisoners present, and
not one of those men betrayed him; they even refrained
from talking upon the subject among themselves,
waiting for the terrible event which must
follow.</p>

<p>As Claude passed on, seeing a young convict of
sixteen yawning idly there, he strongly advised him
to learn how to read. Just then Faillette asked what
he was hiding.</p>

<p>Claude answered unhesitatingly: “An ax to kill
Monsieur D—— to-night; but can you see it?”</p>

<p>“A little,” said Faillette.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock the prisoners were locked in their
several workshops. It was then the custom for the
warders to leave them, until the inspector had been
his rounds.</p>

<p>In Claude’s workshop a most extraordinary scene
took place, the only one of the kind on record. Claude
rose and addressed his companions, eighty-two in
number, Claude included, in the following words:</p>

<p>“You all know Albin and I were like brothers. I
liked him at first for sharing his rations with me,
afterward because he cared for me. Now I never have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1092">[Pg 1092]</span>
sufficient, though I spend the pittance I earn in bread.
It could make no possible difference to the inspector,
Monsieur D——, that we should be together; but he
chose to separate us simply from a love of tormenting,
for he is a bad man. I asked again and again for
Albin to be sent back, without success; and when I
gave him a stated time, the 4th of November, I was
thrust into a dungeon. During that time I became
his judge, and sentenced him to death on November
the 4th. In two hours he will be here, and I warn
you I intend to kill him. But have you anything
to say?”</p>

<p>There was a dead silence. Claude then continued
telling his comrades, the eighty-one thieves, his ideas
on the subject—that he was reduced to a fearful extremity,
and compelled by that very necessity to take
the law into his own hands; that he knew full well he
could not take the inspector’s life without sacrificing
his own, but that as the cause was a just one he would
bear the consequences, having come to this conclusion
after two months’ calm reflection; that if they considered
resentment alone hurried him on to such a step
they were at once to say so, and to state their objections
to the sentence being carried out.</p>

<p>One voice alone broke the silence which followed,
saying, “Before killing the inspector, Claude ought
to give him a chance of relenting.”</p>

<p>“That is but just,” said Claude, “and he shall have
the benefit of the doubt.”</p>

<p>Claude then sorted the few things a poor prisoner
is allowed, and gave them to the comrades he mostly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1093">[Pg 1093]</span>
cared for after Albin, keeping only the pair of scissors.
He then embraced them all—some not being able to
withhold their tears at such a moment. Claude continued
calmly to converse during this last hour, and
even gave way to a trick he had as a boy, of extinguishing
the candle with a breath from his nose.
Seeing him thus, his companions afterward owned
that they hoped he had abandoned his sinister idea.
One young convict looked at him fixedly, trembling
for the coming event.</p>

<p>“Take courage, young fellow,” said Claude, gently;
“it will be but the work of a minute.”</p>

<p>The workshop was a long room with a door at
both ends, and with windows each side overlooking
the benches, thus leaving a pathway up the centre for
the inspector to review the work on both sides of him.
Claude had now resumed his work—something like
Jacques Clement, who did not fail to repeat his prayers.</p>

<p>As the clock sounded the last quarter to nine, Claude
rose and placed himself near the entrance, apparently
calm. Amid the most profound silence the clock
struck nine; the door was thrown open, and the inspector
came in as usual alone, looking quite jovial
and self-satisfied, passing rapidly along, tossing his
head at one; grinding words out to another, little heeding
the eyes fixed so fiercely upon him. Just then he
heard Claude’s step, and turning quickly around said:</p>

<p>“What are you doing here? Why are you not in
your place?” just as he would have spoken to a dog.</p>

<p>Claude answered respectfully, “I wish to speak to
you, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1094">[Pg 1094]</span></p>

<p>“On what subject?”</p>

<p>“Albin.”</p>

<p>“Again!”</p>

<p>“Always the same,” said Claude.</p>

<p>“So then,” replied the inspector, walking along,
“you have not had enough with twenty-four hours in
the blackhole.”</p>

<p>Claude, following him closely, replied: “Sir, return
my companion to me!”</p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Sir,” continued Claude, in a voice which would have
moved Satan, “I implore you to send Albin back to
me; you will then see how I will work. You are free,
and it would matter but little to you; you do not know
the feeling of having only one friend. To me it is
everything, encircled by the prison walls. You can
come and go at your pleasure; I have but Albin. Pray
let him come back to me! You know well he shared
his food with me. What can it matter to you that a
man named Claude Gueux should be in this hall, having
another by his side called Albin? You have but
to say ‘Yes,’ nothing more. Sir, my good sir, I implore
you in the name of Heaven to grant my
prayer!”</p>

<p>Claude, overcome with emotion, waited for the
answer.</p>

<p>“Impossible!” replied the inspector, impatiently; “I
will not recall my words. Now go, you annoyance!”
And with that he hurried on toward the outer door,
amid the breathless silence maintained by the eighty-one
thieves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1095">[Pg 1095]</span></p>

<p>Claude, following and touching the inspector, gently
asked:</p>

<p>“Let me at least know why I am condemned to
death. Why did you separate us?”</p>

<p>“I have already answered you: because I chose,”
replied the inspector.</p>

<p>With that he was about to lift the latch, when
Claude raised the ax, and without one cry the inspector
fell to the ground, with his skull completely
cloven from three heavy blows dealt with the rapidity
of lightning. A fourth completely disfigured his face,
and Claude, in his mad fury, gave another and a useless
blow; for the inspector was dead.</p>

<p>Claude, throwing the ax aside, cried out, “Now for
the other!”</p>

<p>The other was himself; and taking the scissors, <em>his
wife’s</em>, he plunged them into his breast. But the
blade was short, and the chest was deep, and vainly
he strove to give the fatal blow. At last covered with
blood, he fell fainting across the dead. Which of the
two would be considered the victim?</p>

<p>When Claude recovered consciousness he was in
bed, surrounded by every care and covered with bandages.
Near him were Sisters of Charity, and a recorder,
ready to take down his deposition, who with
much interest inquired how he was. Claude had lost
a great deal of blood; but the scissors had done him
a bad turn, inflicting wounds not one of which was
dangerous: the only mortal blows he had struck were
on the body of Monsieur D——. Then the interrogator
commenced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1096">[Pg 1096]</span></p>

<p>“Did you kill the inspector of the prison workshops
at Clarvaux?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Why did you do so?”</p>

<p>“Because I did.”</p>

<p>Claude’s wounds assumed a more serious aspect,
and he was prostrated with a fever which threatened
his life. November, December, January, February
passed, in nursing and preparations, and Claude in
turn was visited by doctor and judge—the one to
restore him to health, the other to glean the evidence
needful to send him to the scaffold.</p>

<p>On the 16th of March, 1832, perfectly cured,
Claude appeared in court at Troyes, to answer the
charge brought against him. His appearance impressed
the court favorably; he had been shaved and
stood bareheaded, but still clad in prison garb. The
court was well guarded by a strong military guard, to
keep the witnesses within bounds, as they were all
convicts.</p>

<p>But an unexpected difficulty occurred: not one
of these men would give evidence; neither questions
nor threats availed to make them break their
silence, until Claude requested them to do so. Then
they in turn gave a faithful account of the terrible
event; and if one, from forgetfulness or affection for
the accused, failed to relate the whole facts, Claude
supplied the deficiency. At one time the women’s
tears fell fast.</p>

<p>The usher now called the convict Albin. He came
in trembling with emotion and sobbing painfully, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1097">[Pg 1097]</span>
threw himself into Claude’s arms. Turning to the
Public Prosecutor, Claude said:</p>

<p>“Here is a convict who gives his food to the
hungry,” and stooping, he kissed Albin’s hand.</p>

<p>All the witnesses having been examined, the counsel
for the prosecution then rose to address the court.
“Gentlemen of the jury, society would be utterly put
to confusion if a public prosecution did not condemn
great culprits like him, who,” etc.</p>

<p>After the long address by the prosecution, Claude’s
counsel rose.</p>

<p>Then followed the usual pleading for and against,
which ever takes place at the criminal court.</p>

<p>Claude in his turn gave evidence, and every one was
astonished at his intelligence; there appeared far more
of the orator about this poor workman than the assassin.
In a clear and straightforward way he detailed
the facts as they were—standing proudly there, resolved
to tell the whole truth. At times the crowd was
carried away by his eloquence. This man, who could
not read, would grasp the most difficult points of
argument, yet treat the judges with all due deference.
Once Claude lost his temper, when the counsel for
the prosecution stated that he had assassinated the
inspector without provocation.</p>

<p>“What!” cried Claude, “I had no provocation? Indeed!
A drunkard strikes me—I kill him; then you
would allow there was provocation, and the penalty
of death would be changed for that of the galleys.
But a man who wounds me in every way during four
years, humiliates me for four years, taunts me daily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1098">[Pg 1098]</span>
hourly, for four years, and heaps every insult on my
head—what follows? You consider I have had no
provocation! I had a wife for whom I robbed—he
tortured me about her. I had a child for whom I
robbed—he taunted me about this child. I was hungry,
a friend shared his bread with me—he took away my
friend. I begged him to return my friend to me—he
cast me into a dungeon. I told him how much I suffered—he
said it wearied him to listen. What then
would you have me do? I took his life; and you look
upon me as a monster for killing this man, and you
decapitate me; then do so.”</p>

<p>Provocation such as this the law fails to acknowledge,
because the blows leave no marks to show.</p>

<p>The judge then summed up the case in a clear and
impartial manner—dwelling on the life Claude had
led, living openly with an improper character; then he
had robbed, and ended by being a murderer. All this
was true. Before the jury retired, the judge asked
Claude if he had any questions to ask, or anything
to say.</p>

<p>“Very little,” said Claude. “I am a murderer, I
am a thief; but I ask you, gentlemen of this jury, why
did I kill? Why did I steal?”</p>

<p>The jury retired for a quarter of an hour, and according
to the judgment of these twelve countrymen—<em>gentlemen
of the jury</em>, as they are styled—Claude
Gueux was condemned to death. At the very outset
several of them were much impressed with the name
of Gueux (vagabond); and that influenced their
decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1099">[Pg 1099]</span></p>

<p>When the verdict was pronounced, Claude simply
said: “Very well; but there are two questions these
gentlemen have not answered. Why did this man
steal? What made him a murderer?”</p>

<p>He made a good supper that night, exclaiming,
“Thirty-six years have now passed me.” He refused
to make any appeal until the last minute, but at the
instance of one of the sisters who nursed him he consented
to do so. She in her fulness of heart gave him
a five-franc piece.</p>

<p>His fellow-prisoners, as we have already noticed,
were devoted to him, and placed all the means at their
disposal to help him to escape. They threw into his
dungeon, through the air-hole, a nail, some wire, the
handle of a pail: any one of these would have been
enough for a man like Claude to free himself from
his chains. He gave them all up to the warder.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June, 1832, seven months and four
days after the murder, the recorder of the court came,
and Claude was told that he had but one hour more
to live, for his appeal had been rejected.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Claude, coldly; “I slept well last
night, and doubtless I shall pass my next even better.”</p>

<p>First came the priest, then the executioner. He
was humble to the priest, and listened to him with
great attention, regretting much that he had not had
the benefit of religious training, at the same time
blaming himself for much in the past. He was courteous
in his manner to the executioner; in fact he gave
up all—his soul to the priest, his body to the
executioner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1100">[Pg 1100]</span></p>

<p>While his hair was being cut, some one mentioned
how the cholera was spreading, and Troyes at any
moment might become a prey to this fearful scourge.
Claude joined in the conversation, saying, with a smile,
“There is one thing to be said—I have no fear of the
cholera!” He had broken half of the scissors—what
remained he asked the jailor to give to Albin; the other
half lay buried in his chest. He also wished the day’s
rations to be taken to his friend. The only trifle he
retained was the five-franc piece that the sister had
given him, which he kept in his right hand after he
was bound.</p>

<p>At a quarter to eight the dismal procession usual
in such cases left the prison. Pale, but with a firm
tread, Claude Gueux slowly mounted the scaffold,
keeping his eyes fixed on the crucifix the priest carried—an
emblem of the Saviour’s suffering. He wished
to embrace the priest and the executioner, thanking
the one and pardoning the other; the executioner
simply repulsed him. Just before he was bound to
the infernal machine, he gave the five-franc piece to
the priest saying, “For the poor.”</p>

<p>The hour had scarcely struck its eight chimes, when
this man, so noble, so intelligent, received the fatal
blow which severed his head from his body.</p>

<p>A market-day had been chosen for the time of execution,
as there would be more people about; for
there are still in France small towns that glory in
having an execution. The guillotine that day remained,
inflaming the imagination of the mob to such
an extent that one of the tax-gatherers was nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1101">[Pg 1101]</span>
murdered. Such is the admirable effect of public
executions!</p>

<p>We have given the history of Claude Gueux’s life,
more to solve a difficult problem than for aught else.
In his life there are two questions to be considered—before
his fall and after his fall. What was his training
and what was the penalty? This must interest
society generally; for this man was well gifted, his
instincts were good. Then what was wanting? On
this revolves the grand problem which would place
society on a firm basis.</p>

<p><em>What Nature has begun in the individual, let society
carry out.</em> Look at Claude Gueux. An intelligent and
most noble-hearted man, placed in the midst of evil
surroundings, he turned thief. Society placed him in
a prison where the evil was yet greater, and he ended
with becoming a murderer. Can we really blame him,
or ourselves?—questions which require deep thought,
or the result will be that we shall be compelled to
shirk this most important subject. The facts are now
before us, and if the government gives no thought to
the matter, what are the rulers about?...</p>

<p><em>Alexandre Dumas, called Père, to distinguish

<h2 class="nobreak">A BAL MASQUÉ</h2>
</div>

<p class="center p2b big1">BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS</p>


<p>I said that I was in to no one; one of my friends
forced admission.</p>

<p>My servant announced Mr. Anthony R——.
Behind Joseph’s livery I saw the corner of a black redingote<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>;
it is probable that the wearer of the redingote,
from his side, saw a flap of my dressing gown; impossible
to conceal myself.</p>

<p>“Very well! Let him enter,” I said out loud. “Let
him go to the Devil,” I said to myself.</p>

<p>While working it is only the woman you love who
can disturb you with impunity, for she is always at
bottom interested in what you are doing.</p>

<p>I went up to him, therefore, with the half-bored
face of an author interrupted in one of those moments
of sorest self-mistrust, while I found him so pale and
haggard that the first words I addressed to him were
these:</p>

<p>“What is the matter? What has happened to you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Let me take breath,” said he. “I’m going
to tell you all about it, besides, it’s a dream perhaps,
or perhaps I am mad.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1106">[Pg 1106]</span></p>
<p>He threw himself into an armchair, and let his
head drop between his hands.</p>

<p>I looked at him in astonishment; his hair was dripping
with rain; his shoes, his knees, and the bottom
of his trousers were covered with mud. I went to
the window; I saw at the door his servant and his
cabriolet; I could make nothing out of it all.</p>

<p>He saw my surprise.</p>

<p>“I have been to the cemetery of Père-Lachaise,”
said he.</p>

<p>“At ten o’clock in the morning?”</p>

<p>“I was there at seven—cursed bal masqué!”</p>

<p>I could not imagine what a bal masqué and Père-Lachaise
had to do with one another. I resigned myself,
and turning my back to the mantelpiece began
to roll a cigarette for him between my fingers with
the phlegm and the patience of a Spaniard.</p>

<p>While he was coming to the point I hinted to
Anthony that I, for my part, was commonly very susceptible
to attentions of that kind.</p>

<p>He made me a sign of thanks, but pushed my hand
away.</p>

<p>Finally I bent over to light the cigarette for myself:
Anthony stopped me.</p>

<p>“Alexandre,” he said to me, “Listen, I beg of you.”</p>

<p>“But you have been here already a quarter of an
hour and have not told me anything.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it is a most strange adventure.”</p>

<p>I got up, placed my cigarette on the mantelpiece and
crossed my arms like a man resigned; only I began
to believe, as he did, that he was fast becoming mad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1107">[Pg 1107]</span></p>

<p>“You remember the ball at the Opera, where I met
you?” he said to me after a moment’s silence.</p>

<p>“The last one where there were at least two hundred
people?”</p>

<p>“The very same. I left you with the intention of
abandoning myself to one of those varieties of which
they spoke to me as being a curiosity even in the
midst of our curious times; you wished to dissuade me
from going; a fatality drove me on. Oh! you, why
did you not see it all, you who have the knack of observation?
Why were not Hoffman or Callot there to
paint the picture as the fantastic, burlesque thing
kept unrolling itself beneath my eyes? Unsatisfied
and in melancholy mood I walked away, about to
quit the Opera; I came to a hall that was overflowing
and in high spirits: corridors, boxes, parterre. Everything
was obstructed. I made a tour of the room;
twenty masks called me by name and told me theirs.
These were all leaders—aristocrats and merchants—in
the undignified disguise of pierrots, of postilions, of
merry-andrews, or of fishwives. They were all
young people of family, of culture, of talent; and
there, forgetful of family, talent, breeding, they were
resurrecting in the midst of our sedate and serious
times a soirée of the Regency. They had told me
about it, and yet I could not have believed it!—I
mounted a few steps and leaning against a pillar,
half hidden by it, I fixed my eyes on that sea of
human beings surging beneath me. Their dominoes,
of all colors, their motley costumes, their grotesque
disguises formed a spectacle resembling nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1108">[Pg 1108]</span>
human. The music began to play. Oh, it was then
these gargoyle creatures stirred themselves to the
sound of that orchestra whose harmony reached me
only in the midst of cries, of laughs, of hootings; they
hung on to each other by their hands, by their arms,
by their necks; a long coil formed itself, beginning
with a circular motion, the dancers, men and women,
stamping with their feet, made the dust break forth
with a noise, the atoms of which were rendered visible
by the wan light of the lustres; turning at ever-increasing
speed with bizarre postures, with unseemly
gestures, with cries full of abandonment; turning
always faster and still faster, swaying and swinging
like drunken men, yelling like lost women, with more
delirium than delight, with more passion than
pleasure; resembling a coil of the damned doing infernal
penance under the scourge of demons! All
this passed beneath my eyes, at my feet. I felt the
wind of their whirling past; as they rushed by each
one whom I knew flung a word at me that made me
blush. All this noise, all this humming, all this confusion,
all this music went on in my brain as well as
in the room! I soon came to the point of no longer
knowing whether that which I had before my eyes
was a dream or reality; I came to the point of asking
myself whether it was not I who was mad and they
who were sane; I was seized with a weird temptation
to throw myself into the midst of this pandemonium,
like Faust through the Witches’ Sabbath, and I felt
that I too, would then have cries, postures, laughs like
theirs. Oh! from that to madness there is but one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1109">[Pg 1109]</span>
step. I was appalled; I flung myself out of the room,
followed even to the street door by shrieks that were
like those cries of passion that come out of the caverns
of the fallow deer.</p>

<p>“I stopped a moment under the portico to collect
myself; I did not wish to venture into the street; with
such confusion still in my soul I might not be able to
find my way; I might, perhaps, be thrown under the
wheels of some carriage I had not seen coming. I
was as a drunken man might be who begins to recover
sufficient reason in his clouded brain to recognize his
condition, and who, feeling the will return but not the
power, with fixed eyes and staring, leans motionless
against some street post or some tree on the public
promenade.</p>

<p>“At that moment a carriage stopped before the
door, a woman alighted or rather shot herself from
the doorway.</p>

<p>“She entered beneath the peristyle, turning her head
from right to left like one who had lost her way; she
was dressed in a black domino, had her face covered
by a velvet mask. She presented herself at the
door.</p>

<p>“‘Your ticket,’ said the doorkeeper.</p>

<p>“‘My ticket?’ she replied. ‘I have none.’</p>

<p>“‘Then get one at the box-office.’</p>

<p>“The domino came back under the peristyle,
fumbled nervously about in all her pockets.</p>

<p>“‘No money!’ she cried. ‘Ah! this ring—a ticket
of admission for this ring,’ she said.</p>

<p>“‘Impossible,’ replied the woman who was distributing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1110">[Pg 1110]</span>
the cards; ‘we do not make bargains of
that kind.’</p>

<p>“And she pushed away the brilliant, which fell to
the ground and rolled to my side.</p>

<p>“The domino remained still without moving, forgetting
the ring, sunk in thought.</p>

<p>“I picked up the ring and handed it to her.</p>

<p>“Through her mask I saw her eyes fixed on mine.</p>

<p>“‘You must help me to get in,’ she said to me;
‘You must, for pity’s sake.’</p>

<p>“‘But I am going out, madame,’ I said to her.</p>

<p>“‘Then give me six francs for this ring, and you
will render me a service for which I shall bless you
my life long.’</p>

<p>“I replaced the ring on her finger; I went to the
box-office, I took two tickets. We reentered together.</p>

<p>“As we arrived within the corridor I felt that she
was tottering. Then with her second hand she made
a kind of ring around my arm.</p>

<p>“‘Are you in pain?’ I asked her.</p>

<p>“‘No, no, it is nothing,’ she replied, ‘a dizziness,
that is all—’</p>

<p>“She hurried me into the hall.</p>

<p>“We reentered into that giddy Charenton.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>“Three times we made the tour, breaking our way
with great difficulty through the waves of masks that
were hurling themselves one upon the other; she trembling
at every unseemly word that came to her ear; I
blushing to be seen giving my arm to a woman who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1111">[Pg 1111]</span>would thus put herself in the way of such words; then
we returned to the end of the hall.</p>

<p>“She fell upon a sofa. I remained standing in
front of her, my hand leaning on the back of her seat.</p>

<p>“‘Oh! this must seem to you very bizarre,’ she said,
‘but not more so than to me, I swear to you. I have
not the slightest idea of all this’ (she looked at the
ball), ‘for even in my dreams I could not imagine
such things. But they wrote me, you see, that he
would be here with a woman, and what sort of a
woman should it be who could come to a place like
this?’</p>

<p>“I made a gesture of surprise; she understood.</p>

<p>“‘But <em>I</em> am here, you wish to ask, do you not? Oh!
but for me that is another thing: I, I am looking for
him; I, I am his wife. As for these people, it is madness
and dissipation that drives them hither. But I,
I, it is jealousy infernal! I have been everywhere
looking for him; I have been all night in a cemetery;
I have been at Grève<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> on the day of an execution; and
yet, I swear to you, as a young girl I have never once
gone into the street without my mother; as a wife I
have never taken one step out of doors without being
followed by a lackey; and yet here I am, the same
as all these women who are so familiar with the
way; here I am giving my arm to a man whom I do
not know, blushing under my mask at the opinion he
ought to have of me! I know all this!—Have you
ever been jealous, monsieur?’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1112">[Pg 1112]</span></p>
<p>“‘Unhappily,’ I replied to her.</p>

<p>“‘Then you will forgive me, for you understand.
You know that voice that cries out to you “Do!”
as in the ear of a madman; you have felt that arm that
pushes one into shame and crime, like the arm of fate.
You know that at such a moment one is capable of
everything, if one can only get vengeance.’</p>

<p>“I was about to reply; all at once she rose, her eyes
fastened on two dominoes that were passing in front
of us at that moment.</p>

<p>“‘Silence!’ she said.</p>

<p>“And she hurried me on following in their footsteps.
I was thrown into the middle of an intrigue
of which I understood nothing; I could feel all the
threads vibrating, but could take hold of none of them
by the end; but this poor wife seemed so troubled that
she became interesting. I obeyed like a child, so imperious
is real feeling, and we set ourselves to follow
the two masks, one of which was evidently a man, the
other a woman. They spoke in a low voice; the sounds
reached our ears with difficulty.</p>

<p>“‘It is he!’ she murmured; ‘it is his voice; yes, yes,
that is his figure—’</p>

<p>“The latter of the two dominoes began to laugh.</p>

<p>“‘That is his laugh,’ said she; ‘it is he, monsieur,
it is he! The letter said true, O, mon Dieu, mon
Dieu!’</p>

<p>“In the mean while the two masks kept on, and we
followed them always. They went out of the hall,
and we went out after them; they took the stairs leading
to the boxes, and we ascended in their footsteps;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1113">[Pg 1113]</span>
they did not stop till they came to the boxes in the
centre; we were like their two shadows. A little
closed box was opened; they entered it; the door
again closed upon them.</p>

<p>“The poor creature I was supporting on my arm
frightened me by her excitement. I could not see her
face, but crushed against me as she was, I could
feel her heart beating, her body shivering, her limbs
trembling. There was something uncanny in the way
there came to me such knowledge of unheard-of suffering,
the spectacle of which I had before my very
eyes, of whose victim I knew nothing, and of the
cause of which I was completely ignorant. Nevertheless,
for nothing in this world would I have abandoned
that woman at such a moment.</p>

<p>“As she saw the two masks enter the box and the
box close upon them, she stopped still a moment, motionless,
and as if overwhelmed. Then she sprang
forward to the door to listen. Placed as she was her
slightest movement would betray her presence and
ruin her; I dragged her back violently by the arm, I
lifted the latch of the adjoining box, I drew her in
after me, I lowered the grille and pulled the door to.</p>

<p>“‘If you wish to listen,’ I said to her, ‘at least listen
from here.’</p>

<p>“She fell upon one knee and flattened her ear
against the partition, and I—I held myself erect on
the opposite side, my arms crossed, my head bent and
thoughtful.</p>

<p>“All that I had been able to observe of that woman
seemed to me to indicate a type of beauty. The lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1114">[Pg 1114]</span>
part of her face, which was not concealed by her mask,
was youthful, velvety, and round; her lips were scarlet
and delicate; her teeth, which the black velvet mask
falling just above them made appear still whiter, were
small, separated, and glistening; her hand was one to
be modeled, her figure to be held between the fingers;
her black hair, silky, escaped in profusion from beneath
the hood of her domino, and the foot of a child, that
played in and out under her skirt, looked as if it should
have trouble in balancing her body, all lithe, all graceful,
all airy as it was. Oh! what a marvelous piece of
perfection must she be! Oh! he that should hold her
in his arms, that should see every faculty of that spirit
absorbed in loving him, that should feel the beating of
her heart against his, her tremblings, her nervous palpitations,
and that should be able to say: ‘All of this,
all of this, comes of love, of love for me, for me alone
among all the millions of men, for me, angel predestined!
Oh! that man!—that man!—’</p>

<p>“Such were my thoughts, when all at once I saw
that woman rise, turn toward me, and say to me in a
voice broken and fierce:</p>

<p>“‘Monsieur, I am beautiful, I swear it; I am young,
I am but nineteen. Until now I have been white as
an angel of the Creation—ah, well—’ she threw both
arms about my neck,‘—ah, well, I am yours—take
me!—’</p>

<p>“At the same instant I felt her lips pressed close to
mine, and the effect of a bite, rather than that of a
kiss, ran shuddering and dismayed through my whole
body; over my eyes passed a cloud of flame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1115">[Pg 1115]</span></p>

<p>“Ten minutes later I was holding her in my arms,
in a swoon, half dead and sobbing.</p>

<p>“Slowly she came to herself; through her mask I
made out how haggard were her eyes; I saw the lower
part of her pale face, I heard her teeth chatter one
upon the other, as in the chill of a fever. I see it all
once more.</p>

<p>“She remembered all that had taken place, and fell at
my feet.</p>

<p>“‘If you have any compassion,’ she said to me,
sobbing, ‘any pity, turn away your eyes from me,
never seek to know me; let me go and forget me. I
will remember for two!’</p>

<p>“At these words she rose again; quickly, like a
thought that escapes us, she darted toward the door,
opened it, and coming back again, ‘Do not follow me,
in heaven’s name, Monsieur, do not follow me!’ she
said.</p>

<p>“The door pushed violently open, closed again between
her and me, stole her from my sight, like an
apparition. I have never seen her more!</p>

<p>“I have never seen her more! And ever since, ever
since the six months that have glided by, I have sought
her everywhere, at balls, at spectacles, at promenades.
Every time I have seen from a distance a woman with
lithe figure, with a foot like a child’s, with black hair,
I have followed her, I have drawn near to her, I have
looked into her face, hoping that her blushes would
betray her. Nowhere have I found her again, in no
place have I seen her again—except at night, except
in my dreams! Oh! there, there she reappears; there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1116">[Pg 1116]</span>
I feel her, I feel her embraces, her biting caresses so
ardent, as if she had something of the devil in her;
then the mask has fallen and a face most grotesque appeared
to me at times blurred as if veiled in a cloud;
sometimes brilliant, as if circled by an aureole; sometimes
pale, with a skull white and naked, with eyes
vanished from the orbits, with teeth chattering and
few. In short, ever since that night, I have ceased to
live; burning with mad passion for a woman I do not
know, hoping always and always disappointed at my
hopes. Jealous without the right to be so, without
knowing of whom to be jealous, not daring to avow
such madness, and all the time pursued, preyed upon,
wasted away, consumed by her.”</p>

<p>As he finished these words he tore a letter from
his breast.</p>

<p>“Now that I have told you everything,” he said to
me, “take this letter and read it.”</p>

<p>I took the letter and read:</p>

<p>“Have you perhaps forgotten a poor woman who
has forgotten nothing and who dies because she can
not forget?</p>

<p>“When you receive this letter I shall be no more.
Then go to the cemetery of Père-Lachaise, tell the
concierge to let you see among the newest graves one
that bears on its stone the simple name ‘Marie,’ and
when you are face to face with that grave, fall on
your knees and pray.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well!” continued Anthony, “I received that
letter yesterday, and I went there this morning. The
concierge conducted me to the grave, and I remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1117">[Pg 1117]</span>
two hours on my knees there, praying and weeping.
Do you understand? She was there, that woman.
Her flaming spirit had stolen away; the body consumed
by it had bowed, even to breaking, beneath
the burden of jealousy and of remorse; she was there,
under my feet, and she had lived, and she had died,
for me unknown; unknown!—and taking a place in
my life as she had taken one in the grave; unknown!—and
burying in my heart a corpse, cold and lifeless,
as she had buried one in the sepulchre—Oh! Do you
know anything to equal it? Do you know any event
so appalling? Therefore, now, no more hope. I will
see her again never. I would dig up her grave that I
might recover, perhaps, some traces wherewithal to reconstruct
her face; and I love her always! Do you
understand, Alexandre? I love her like a madman;
and I would kill myself this instant in order to rejoin
her, if she were not to remain unknown to me for
eternity, as she was unknown to me in this world.”</p>

<p>With these words he snatched the letter from my
hands, kissed it over and over again, and began to
weep like a little child.</p>

<p>I took him in my arms, and not knowing what to
say to him, I wept with him.</p>

<p><em>Prosper Mérimée, novelist, historian, dramatist,
and critic, was born in Paris in 1803.
Rarely gifted and highly educated, he held
various offices in the civil service, was an
Academician, and in 1853 a Senator of the Empire.
He was a great traveler, and through
his tact and engaging personality was welcomed
among all classes, observing wherever
he went, and gathering material for his stories,
in which a great variety of types are noticeable.
His literary style—clear, simple, artistic—is
considered a model of restraint and conciseness.
“Carmen,” on which Bizet’s opera is
founded, and the novel, “Columba,” are probably
the best known of his works. The latter
part of his life he devoted to introducing
through his own translation the great Russian
authors, Poushkin, Gogol, and Turgenev. The
famous “Lettres à une Inconnue” were published
after his death at Cannes, in 1870,
where they have lately erected a monument to
him.</em></p>

</div>

<p class="center big1">BY PROSPER MÉRIMÉE</p>


<p class="center p2b">Copyright, 1896, by The Current Literature Publishing Company.</p>


<p>A friend of mine, a soldier, who died in Greece
of fever some years since, described to me
one day his first engagement. His story so
impressed me that I wrote it down from memory. It
was as follows:</p>

<p>I joined my regiment on September 4th. It was
evening. I found the colonel in the camp. He received
me rather bruskly, but having read the general’s
introductory letter he changed his manner and
addressed me courteously.</p>

<p>By him I was presented to my captain, who had
just come in from reconnoitring. This captain, whose
acquaintance I had scarcely time to make, was a tall,
dark man, of harsh, repelling aspect. He had been
a private soldier, and had won his cross and epaulettes
upon the field of battle. His voice, which was hoarse
and feeble, contrasted strangely with his gigantic
stature. This voice of his he owed, as I was told, to
a bullet which had passed completely through his body
at the battle of Jena.</p>

<p>On learning that I had just come from college at
Fontainebleau, he remarked, with a wry face: “My
lieutenant died last night.”</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1122">[Pg 1122]</span></p>

<p>I understood what he implied, “It is for you to take
his place, and you are good for nothing.”</p>

<p>A sharp retort was on my tongue, but I restrained it.</p>

<p>The moon was rising behind the redoubt of Cheverino,
which stood two cannon-shots from our encampment.
The moon was large and red, as is
common at her rising; but that night she seemed to
me of extraordinary size. For an instant the redoubt
stood out coal-black against the glittering disk. It
resembled the cone of a volcano at the moment of
eruption.</p>

<p>An old soldier, at whose side I found myself, observed
the color of the moon.</p>

<p>“She is very red,” he said. “It is a sign that it will
cost us dear to win this wonderful redoubt.”</p>

<p>I was always superstitious, and this piece of augury,
coming at that moment, troubled me. I sought my
couch, but could not sleep. I rose, and walked about a
while, watching the long line of fires upon the heights
beyond the village of Cheverino.</p>

<p>When the sharp night air had thoroughly refreshed
my blood I went back to the fire. I rolled my mantle
round me, and I shut my eyes, trusting not to open
them till daybreak. But sleep refused to visit me. Insensibly
my thoughts grew doleful. I told myself that
I had not a friend among the hundred thousand men
who filled that plain. If I were wounded, I should be
placed in hospital, in the hands of ignorant and careless
surgeons. I called to mind what I had heard
of operations. My heart beat violently, and I mechanically
arranged, as a kind of rude cuirass, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1123">[Pg 1123]</span>
handkerchief and pocketbook upon my breast. Then,
overpowered with weariness, my eyes closed drowsily,
only to open the next instant with a start at some new
thought of horror.</p>

<p>Fatigue, however, at last gained the day. When the
drums beat at daybreak I was fast asleep. We were
drawn up in ranks. The roll was called, then we
stacked our arms, and everything announced that we
should pass another uneventful day.</p>

<p>But about three o’clock an aide-de-camp arrived with
orders. We were commanded to take arms.</p>

<p>Our sharpshooters marched into the plain. We
followed slowly, and in twenty minutes we saw the
outposts of the Russians falling back and entering
the redoubt. We had a battery of artillery on our
right, another on our left, but both some distance in
advance of us. They opened a sharp fire upon the
enemy, who returned it briskly, and the redoubt of
Cheverino was soon concealed by volumes of thick
smoke. Our regiment was almost covered from the
Russians’ fire by a piece of rising ground. Their bullets
(which besides were rarely aimed at us, for they
preferred to fire upon our cannoneers) whistled over
us, or at worst knocked up a shower of earth and
stones.</p>

<p>Just as the order to advance was given, the captain
looked at me intently. I stroked my sprouting mustache
with an air of unconcern; in truth, I was not
frightened, and only dreaded lest I might be thought
so. These passing bullets aided my heroic coolness,
while my self-respect assured me that the danger was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1124">[Pg 1124]</span>
a real one, since I was veritably under fire. I was delighted
at my self-possession, and already looked
forward to the pleasure of describing in Parisian
drawing-rooms the capture of the redoubt of
Cheverino.</p>

<p>The colonel passed before our company. “Well,”
he said to me, “you are going to see warm work in
your first action.”</p>

<p>I gave a martial smile, and brushed my cuff, on
which a bullet, which had struck the earth at thirty
paces distant, had cast a little dust.</p>

<p>It appeared that the Russians had discovered that
their bullets did no harm, for they replaced them by
a fire of shells, which began to reach us in the hollows
where we lay. One of these, in its explosion, knocked
off my shako and killed a man beside me.</p>

<p>“I congratulate you,” said the captain, as I picked
up my shako. “You are safe now for the day.”</p>

<p>I knew the military superstition which believes that
the axiom “<em>non bis in idem</em>” is as applicable to the
battlefield as to the courts of justice. I replaced my
shako with a swagger.</p>

<p>“That’s a rude way to make one raise one’s hat,”
I said, as lightly as I could. And this wretched piece
of wit was, in the circumstances, received as excellent.</p>

<p>“I compliment you,” said the captain. “You will
command a company to-night; for I shall not survive
the day. Every time I have been wounded the officer
below me has been touched by some spent ball; and,”
he added, in a lower tone, “all the names began
with P.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1125">[Pg 1125]</span></p>

<p>I laughed skeptically; most people would have done
the same; but most would also have been struck, as I
was, by these prophetic words. But, conscript though
I was, I felt that I could trust my thoughts to no one,
and that it was my duty to seem always calm and
bold.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour the Russian fire had
sensibly diminished. We left our cover to advance
on the redoubt.</p>

<p>Our regiment was composed of three battalions.
The second had to take the enemy in flank; the two
others formed a storming party. I was in the third.</p>

<p>On issuing from behind the cover, we were received
by several volleys, which did but little harm.
The whistling of the balls amazed me. “But after
all,” I thought, “a battle is less terrible than I
expected.”</p>

<p>We advanced at a smart run, our musketeers in
front.</p>

<p>All at once the Russians uttered three hurrahs—three
distinct hurrahs—and then stood silent, without
firing.</p>

<p>“I don’t like that silence,” said the captain. “It
bodes no good.”</p>

<p>I began to think our people were too eager. I could
not help comparing, mentally, their shouts and clamor
with the striking silence of the enemy.</p>

<p>We quickly reached the foot of the redoubt. The
palisades were broken and the earthworks shattered
by our balls. With a roar of “Vive l’Empereur,” our
soldiers rushed across the ruins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1126">[Pg 1126]</span></p>

<p>I raised my eyes. Never shall I forget the sight
which met my view. The smoke had mostly lifted,
and remained suspended, like a canopy, at twenty feet
above the redoubt. Through a bluish mist could be
perceived, behind the shattered parapet, the Russian
Grenadiers, with rifles lifted, as motionless as statues.
I can see them still—the left eye of every soldier
glaring at us, the right hidden by his lifted gun. In
an embrasure at a few feet distant, a man with a
fuse stood by a cannon.</p>

<p>I shuddered. I believed that my last hour had come.</p>

<p>“Now for the dance to open,” cried the captain.
These were the last words I heard him speak.</p>

<p>There came from the redoubts a roll of drums. I
saw the muzzles lowered. I shut my eyes; I heard a
most appalling crash of sound, to which succeeded
groans and cries. Then I looked up, amazed to find
myself still living. The redoubt was once more
wrapped in smoke. I was surrounded by the dead
and wounded. The captain was extended at my feet;
a ball had carried off his head, and I was covered with
his blood. Of all the company, only six men, except
myself, remained erect.</p>

<p>This carnage was succeeded by a kind of stupor.
The next instant the colonel, with his hat on his
sword’s point, had scaled the parapet with a cry of
“Vive l’Empereur.” The survivors followed him.
All that succeeded is to me a kind of dream. We
rushed into the redoubt, I know not how, we fought
hand to hand in the midst of smoke so thick that no
man could perceive his enemy. I found my sabre dripping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1127">[Pg 1127]</span>
blood; I heard a shout of “Victory”; and, in
the clearing smoke, I saw the earthworks piled with
dead and dying. The cannons were covered with a
heap of corpses. About two hundred men in the
French uniform were standing, without order, loading
their muskets or wiping their bayonets. Eleven
Russian prisoners were with them.</p>

<p>The colonel was lying, bathed in blood, upon a
broken cannon. A group of soldiers crowded round
him. I approached them.</p>

<p>“Who is the oldest captain?” he was asking of a
sergeant.</p>

<p>The sergeant shrugged his shoulders most expressively.</p>

<p>“Who is the oldest lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“This gentleman, who came last night,” replied the
sergeant calmly.</p>

<p>The colonel smiled bitterly.</p>

<p>“Come, sir,” he said to me, “you are now in chief
command. Fortify the gorge of the redoubt at once
with wagons, for the enemy is out in force. But
General C—— is coming to support you.”</p>

<p>“Colonel,” I asked him, “are you badly wounded?”</p>

<p>“Pish, my dear fellow. The redoubt is taken.”</p>

<p><em>Thackeray, writing from Paris to Mrs.
Brookfield in 1849, says of Jules Janin: “He
has made his weekly feuilleton (the Journal
des Débats), famous throughout Europe—he
does not know a word of English, but he translated
Sterne and I think ‘Clarissa Harlowe.’ He
has the most wonderful verve, humor, oddity,
honesty, bonhomie ... bounced about the
room, gesticulating, joking, gasconading, quoting
Latin....” We know that Janin was more
concerned in amusing his readers and himself
than imparting instruction—though he did both.</em></p>

<p><em>Jules Janin was born at Saint-Étienne in
1804, and died in Paris in 1874. In 1836 he
entered on that famous career of forty years
as dramatic critic of the “Journal des Débats.”

<p>So you have never heard the circumstances of
Monsieur Baudelot de Dairval’s marriage, the
man who died four years ago, and was so
mourned by his wife that she died a week later herself,
good lady? Yet it is a story worth telling.</p>

<p>It happened in the Vendée, and the hero, a Vendean,
brave, young, daring, and of fine family, died
tranquilly in his bed without ever suspecting that there
would be a second Vendée.</p>

<p>Baudelot de Dairval was the grandson of that
César Baudelot who is mentioned in the Memoirs of
the Duchess of Orleans, own mother of the regent
Louis Philippe. This woman, who has thrown such
contempt on the greatest names of France, could not
help praising César de Baudelot. Saint-Simon, skeptic
and mocker, but good fellow withal, also spoke
highly of him. So you’ll understand that bearing such
a name young Henri was not lost to report in the first
Vendée, to protest arms in hand against the excesses
of the Revolution. Baudelot was a Vendean simply
because a man of his name and nature could be nothing
else. He fought like his associates, neither more
nor less. He was the friend of Cathelmeau and of
all the others. He took part in those battles of giants;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1132">[Pg 1132]</span>he took part fighting stoutly, and then laughing and
singing as soon as he no longer heard the cries of the
wounded. What wars, what livid tempests were ever
like those? But it is not my business to tell again
the story so often told.</p>

<p>But I want to tell you that one day, surprised at a
farm by a detachment of Blues, Baudelot unexpectedly
called together his troop. “My friends,” said he, “this
farm is surrounded. You must all escape! Take
with you the women and children. Rejoin our chief,
Cathelmeau. As for me, I’ll stay and defend the gate.
I certainly can hold it alone for ten minutes. Those
three thousand out there would massacre us all. Good-by,
good-by, my brave fellows! Don’t forget me!
It’s my turn to-day. You’ll get yourselves killed
to-morrow!”</p>

<p>In those exceptional times and in that exceptional
war, nothing seemed astonishing. Men did not even
think of those rivalries in heroism so frequent in elegant
warfare. In such a struggle of extermination
there was no time to pose for sublimity of soul.
Heroism was quite unaffected. So Baudelot’s soldiers
judged for themselves that their chief spoke sensibly,
and obeyed as simply as he had commanded. They
withdrew by the roof, taking away the women and
children. Baudelot remained at the door making noise
enough for forty, haranguing, disputing and discharging
his gun. One would have thought a whole regiment
ready to fire was stationed there, and the Blues
held themselves on the alert. Baudelot remained on
the defensive as long as he had any voice. But when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1133">[Pg 1133]</span>
that failed and he thought his troop must have reached
a place of safety, he tired of the warlike feint. He
felt ill at ease at thus commanding the absent; and
keeping quiet, he merely propped up the door as it was
shaken from outside. This lasted several minutes,
then the door cracked, and the Blues began to fire
through the fissures. Baudelot was not wounded, and
as his meal had been interrupted, he returned to the
table and tranquilly ate some bread and cheese, and
emptied a pitcher of country wine, thinking meanwhile
that this was his last repast!</p>

<p>Finally the Blues forced the door and rushed in. It
took them some minutes to clear away obstructions,
and to recognize each other in the smoke of their
guns. These soldiers of the Republic hunted eagerly
with look and sword for the armed troop which had
withstood them so long. Judge their surprise at seeing
only a tall, very handsome young man, calmly eating
black bread moistened with wine. Dumb with astonishment
the conquerors stopped and leaned on their
guns, and thus gave Henri Baudelot time to swallow
his last mouthful.</p>

<p>“To your health, gentlemen!” he said, lifting his
glass to his lips. “The garrison thanks you for the
respite you have granted.” At the same time he rose,
and going straight to the Captain, said: “Monsieur, I
am the only person in this house. I am quite ready
for death.”</p>

<p>Then he kept quiet, and waited. To his great surprise
he was not shot at once. Perhaps he had fallen
into the hands of recruits so little exercised as to delay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1134">[Pg 1134]</span>
twenty-four hours before killing a man. Perhaps his
captors were moved by his coolness and fine bearing,
and were ashamed at setting three hundred to kill one.
We must remember that in that sad war there were
French feelings on both sides.</p>

<p>So they contented themselves with tying his hands
and leading him, closely watched, to a manor on the
outskirts of Nantes, which, once an attractive country-seat,
had now become a kind of fortress. Its master
was no other than the chief of the Blues, who had
captured Baudelot. This Breton, a gentleman although
a Blue, had been one of the first to share revolutionary
transports. He was one of those nobles so heroic to
their own injury, who renounced in a day fortunes,
coats of arms, and their own names, forgetting both
what they had promised their fathers and what they
owed to their sons, equally oblivious of past and future,
and unfortunate victims of the present. But we will not
reproach them, for either they died under the stroke
of the Revolution, or lived long enough to see that all
their sacrifices were vain.</p>

<p>Baudelot de Dairval was confined in the donjon, or,
rather, in the pigeon-house of his conqueror. The
doves had been expelled to give place to Chouan
captives. Still covered with shining slates, still surmounted
by its creaking weather-cock, this prison had
retained a calm, gracious air, and it had not been
thought necessary to bar the openings by which the
pigeons came and went. Much as ever, a little straw
had been added to the usual furniture.</p>

<p>At first the dovecote of a country manor struck him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1135">[Pg 1135]</span>
as a novel prison. He decided that as soon as his
hands were free he would compose a romance upon
it, with a guitar accompaniment. While thus thinking,
he heard a violin and other instruments playing a joyful
march. By piling up the straw against the wall
and leaning on it with his elbow, Baudelot could look
out of one of the openings. He saw a long procession
of young men and pretty women in white gowns,
preceded by village fiddlers, and all merry and joyous.
As it passed at the foot of the dovecote, a pretty girl
looked up attentively. She was fair, slender and
dreamy-looking. Baudelot felt that she knew of the
prisoner, and he began to whistle the air of Richard,
“In an Obscure Tower,” or something of the kind.
For this young man was versed in all kinds of combats
and romances, equally skilful with sword and
guitar, an adept at horsemanship, a fine dancer, a true
gentleman of wit and sword, such as are manufactured
no more.</p>

<p>The wedding procession passed, or, at least, if not
a wedding it was a betrothal, and Baudelot stopped
singing. He heard a sound at his prison door; some
one entered.</p>

<p>It was the master of the house himself. He had
been a Marquis under Capet, now he called himself
simply Hamelin. He was a Blue, but a good fellow
enough. The Republic ruled him body and soul; he
lent his sword and his castle. But he had not become
cruel or wicked in its service. The morning of this
very day, Captain Hamelin, for so he had been appointed
by the Republic, learned that some Chouans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1136">[Pg 1136]</span>
were at his farm, had headed a detachment of Blues
and postponed his betrothal. You know how he had
seized Baudelot. As soon as the Chouan was in keeping
the Captain had returned to his betrothal feast, and
this is the reason why he did not shoot his prisoner at
once or take him to Nantes.</p>

<p>Captain Hamelin was not so thorough a Blue as
to have quite forgotten the hospitable old customs of
Bretagne soil. Therefore, while his friends were sitting
down to table, he felt it incumbent to call upon
his captive.</p>

<p>“Can I do anything for you, monsieur?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said Baudelot, bowing, “I should like
the use of at least one of my hands.”</p>

<p>“Your hands shall be unbound, monsieur,” answered
Hamelin, “if you will promise not to try to
escape. But before you promise, remember that at
six o’clock to-morrow morning you will surely be
taken to Nantes.”</p>

<p>“And shot at eight o’clock just as surely?” asked
Baudelot.</p>

<p>Captain Hamelin was silent.</p>

<p>“Very well, monsieur,” said Baudelot. “Unbind
my hands and unless I’m delivered, I give my word
as a gentleman and a Christian to stay here like a
pigeon with clipped wings.”</p>

<p>Captain Hamelin could not help smiling at his prisoner’s
allusion, and untied his hands.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Baudelot, stretching his arms like a
man stiff from sleep, “now, monsieur, I thank you,
and am truly your servant until to-morrow. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1137">[Pg 1137]</span>
will not be my fault if my gratitude does not last
longer!”</p>

<p>Captain Hamelin said: “If you have any last arrangements—a
will to make, for instance—I will send
you writing materials.” He was touched, for he was
not a Breton for nothing.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Baudelot took his hand. “Do you
know,” he said sadly, “that simple word ‘will’ wounds
me more than the words ‘death at Nantes!’ It recalls
that all my friends are dead. There is no one to
whom I can bequeath my name, my sword, my love
and my hate, and these are all I have left. Yet, it
must be sweet to dispose of a fortune, to be generous
even beyond the tomb; and while writing last benefits,
to imagine the tears of joys and sorrow they will
cause. That is sweet and honorable, isn’t it, Captain?
I must not think of it.”</p>

<p>“I will send you some dinner,” said Hamelin. “This
is my day of betrothal, and my table is better provided
than usual. My fiancée herself shall serve you,
monsieur.”</p>

<p>In one of the highest apertures of his cage, Baudelot
saw a daisy which had been sown there by one of the
first occupants of the dovecote. The pretty flower
swayed joyously in the wind, and he gathered it and
offered it to the Captain.</p>

<p>“It is our custom at home, Captain, to offer the bride
a gift. Be so good as to give yours this little flower,
which has blossomed in my domain. And now, good
night. I have kept you from your loves long enough.
May God remember your kindness toward me! <span class="pagenum" id="Page_1138">[Pg 1138]</span>Good-by.
Best wishes! Send me some supper, for I’m
hungry and need rest.”</p>

<p>And they separated with friendly looks.</p>

<p>Dinner was brought the young Vendean by a pretty
Breton girl with white teeth, rosy lips and the pensive
air which befitted a shy country maiden, who had
already seen so many proscripts. She served him
zealously, and gave him no peace if he did not eat of
this or that dish, drink this or that wine. It was a
magnificent repast. The dovecote grew fragrant. It
was almost like the time when the winged occupants
of the tower gathered crumbs from the feast. As
the girl was pouring champagne, Baudelot said to her:</p>

<p>“What is your name, my child?”</p>

<p>“My name is Marie,” she answered.</p>

<p>“The same as my cousin’s,” went on the young
man; “and how old are you, Marie?”</p>

<p>“Seventeen years,” said Marie.</p>

<p>“The age of my cousin,” said Baudelot, and as he
thought of his pretty cousin butchered by the executioner,
his heart almost failed him. But he blushed
to weep before this child in whose eyes tears were
gathering, and as he could not speak, he held out his
glass. But the glass was full, and in the last rays of
the sun the champagne sparkled joyously, for wine
sparkled and spring bloomed even during the Terror.
Seeing that his glass was full, Baudelot said:</p>

<p>“You have no glass, Marie?”</p>

<p>“I am not thirsty,” said Marie.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Baudelot, “this bright wine does not
like to be drunk by a man alone. It is convivial by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1139">[Pg 1139]</span>
nature, and rejoices to be among boon companions. It
is the great support of the Fraternity of which you
have heard so much, my poor Marie, and which men
really comprehend so little. Be friendly; dip your
lips in my glass, my pretty Breton, if you would have
me drink champagne once more before I die,” and he
lifted the glass to Marie’s lips. She held them out,
but at the words, “to die,” her heart overflowed, and
copious tears rolled into the joyous wine.</p>

<p>“To your health, Marie!” said Baudelot, and drank
both wine and tears.</p>

<p>Just then they heard the horn, the hautboys, and the
violins. “What’s that?” said the young man setting
down his glass. “God bless me, it’s a ball!”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said Marie, “alas! yes, it’s a ball. My
young mistress did not want dancing, but her lover
and her father insisted. She is very unhappy this
evening.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the young Vendean, “my good Marie,
if you are as kind as I think, you’ll do something for
me! Go, run, fly, tell your mistress that Count Baudelot
de Dairval, Colonel of Light Horse, requests permission
to pay her his respects. Or, no; find my host,
not his bride, and tell him that his prisoner is very
dull, that the noise of the ball will prevent his sleeping,
that the night will be long and cold, that it’s a
charity to snatch an unhappy young man from the sad
thoughts of his last night, that I beg him, in Heaven’s
name, to let me attend his ball. Tell him he has my
word of honor not to try to escape. Tell him all that,
Marie; and tell him whatever else comes into your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1140">[Pg 1140]</span>
heart and mind. Speak loud enough for your mistress
to hear and be interested; and, thanks to you, Marie,
I’m sure he will yield. Then, child, if I am invited,
send your master’s valet. Tell him to bring me clean
linen and powder. There must be some powder still
left in the castle. Tell him to bring me one of his
master’s coats, and get them to lend me my sword just
for the evening. I will not unsheath it. So, Marie,
go, child!” And the prisoner hurried her off and held
her back in a way to make one both laugh and cry.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Captain Hamelin’s valet appeared
in the dovecote. He was a good old fellow,
faithful to powder and to all the old customs.
Although a member of the municipal council, he was
an honest man, devoted to Monsieur Robespierre only
because he alone in all republican France had dared
to continue powder, ruffles, and embroidered vest.</p>

<p>He brought a complete suit, which Captain Hamelin
had ordered when younger and a Marquis, to visit the
court and see the King when there was a court and a
King. This suit was very rich and handsome, the linen
very white, the shoes very fine. Baudelot’s host had
forgotten nothing, not even the perfumes and cosmetics
of an old-time Marquis. Baudelot confided his head
to the valet, who adorned it complaisantly, not without
profound sighs of regret. Baudelot was young and
handsome, but had not been groomed for some time.
Therefore when he saw himself dressed, curled and
fresh shaven, his eyes animated by a good meal and
by the music in the distance, he could not help smiling
with self-content and recalling his beautiful nights at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1141">[Pg 1141]</span>
the “bal masqué” and at the opera with the Count de
Mirabeau.</p>

<p>He lacked only his sword, which was given him
at the door with a reminder of his promise. It was
night when he crossed the garden to the ballroom.</p>

<p>All the most beautiful republican ladies of the province
were there. But you know women are not so
revolutionary that they do not feel aristocratic sympathy
for a young and handsome gentleman who is to
be shot on the morrow.</p>

<p>To return to our story. The betrothal ball had begun.
The fiancée was Mademoiselle de Mailly, grand-niece
of the beautiful De Mailly so beloved of Madame
de Maintenon. She was a sad young blonde, evidently
unhappy at dancing and marrying in that period of
proscription. She was one of those strong spirits
which seem weak until a certain fatal hour has
sounded, when apparent weakness becomes invincible
energy. The heroine replaces the little girl, and the
ruins of a whole world could not intimidate her, who,
until then, trembled at the least sign of displeasure.</p>

<p>Eleanor de Mailly was then very dejected. The
friends of her childhood imitated her silence and despondency.
Never before was Bretagne feast so
gloomy. Nothing went as it should, neither dance
nor dancers, and there was general lack of ease. The
young men did not even try to please the pretty girls,
and when the ball had scarcely begun every one wished
it would end.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door into the great hall opened, and
every one looked that way. There entered a pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1142">[Pg 1142]</span>
court gentleman, a lost type, a handsome officer, smiling
and well dressed. He had the dress and elegant
bearing of court. This apparition was in charming
contrast with the dulness of the gathering. The men
and women who were bluest at heart were delighted
to find with them this remnant of the old French
society so suddenly blotted out, alas! And, indeed, it
was charming to see this young proscript, whom death
on the morrow awaited, entering into this republican
company, recalling its gaiety, and thinking of nothing
but to be agreeable and please the ladies, faithful to
the end to his calling of French gentleman!</p>

<p>His entrance took only a minute. Once in the room,
he gave himself up to the ball and went to invite the
first woman he saw. It was the blond girl whom he
had noticed in the garden. She accepted without hesitation,
remembering that republican death, the most
unpleasant of all deaths, was offering her partner a
bloody hand. When the men saw Baudelot dancing,
doomed as he was, they blushed at their own lack of
ardor. All the women were invited to dance at once,
and accepted in order to see Baudelot nearer. So,
thanks to the victim, the ball grew really gay.</p>

<p>Baudelot heartily shared this convulsive pleasure.
His smile was not forced; his dance was light and
graceful. He alone was genuinely entertained. The
others amused themselves in very terror, and became
almost delirious at sight of this beautiful youth, who
was king of the fête far more than the bridegroom.
Animated by such passion, terror, and bloody interest,
the ball took possession of all. Baudelot was everywhere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1143">[Pg 1143]</span>
saluting old ladies like the King of France, and
young ones with joy and admiration, talking to men
in the mad language of youth and of nature mixed
with wit.</p>

<p>The more he yielded to this frank and natural gaiety,
the more he forgot that the night was advancing
with frightful rapidity. And the later it grew the
more the women trembled in their hearts at the thought
that he must really die, for they were near the epoch of
old French honor, which made Baudelot’s presence at
the ball the sign that there was no hope for him.
They knew his word bound him faster than iron chains
could have done. They knew that both Baudelot and
Hamelin were doing right. Baudelot’s pleasure did
no wrong to the committee of public safety. As you
may imagine, then, looks and smiles were very tender,
and more than one sigh escaped at sight of the handsome
proscript. As for him, drunk with success, he
had never been so full of love and passion. So when
he went to dance for the third time with the queen
of the ball, the blond fiancée, he felt her little hand
trembling and trembled in his turn.</p>

<p>For when he glanced at her she was pale and exhausted.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Eleanor?” he asked. “What
is the matter, madame? Out of pity for your partner,
do not tremble and grow so pale!”</p>

<p>Then turning toward the window curtains, which
were moving to the dance music, she pointed out the
dawning light.</p>

<p>“It is morning,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1144">[Pg 1144]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, well!” said Baudelot, “what does it matter?
It is morning. I have passed the most beautiful night
of my life. I have seen you and loved you and been
able to tell you I love you, for you know the dying
don’t lie. And now, good-by, Eleanor, good-by! Be
happy and accept the blessing of the Chouan!”</p>

<p>It was the custom in Brittany at the end of the last
square dance to kiss the lady on the forehead. The
dance finished, Baudelot pressed his lips to Eleanor’s
brow. She grew faint and stood motionless, her brow
supported by his lips. Then she recovered herself and
Baudelot led her to a seat. She made him sit down
beside her and said:</p>

<p>“Listen, you must go. Listen, they are harnessing
the horses to take you to Nantes. Listen, in two hours
you will be dead. Fly, then! If you wish, I will go
with you. Then they will say you fled out of love,
not from fear. Listen, if you will not escape alone, or
with me, I will throw myself under the wheels of the
carriage, and you will pass over my broken body!”</p>

<p>She said this in a low tone, without looking at him,
and almost smiling, as though speaking of another
ball.</p>

<p>Baudelot did not listen, but he looked at her with a
joy in his heart such as he never before felt.</p>

<p>“How I love her!” he said to himself. He answered:
“You know very well that is impossible,
Eleanor. Oh, yes; if I were free, you should have no
husband but me, but I do not belong either to myself or
to you. So good-by, beautiful angel, and if you love
me give me back the wild flower I sent you from my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1145">[Pg 1145]</span>
prison. Give it back, Eleanor. The little flower has
been on your breast, it will help me to die.”</p>

<p>At that moment Eleanor looked like death. There
was a solemn silence. The music had stopped, and
daylight was filling the room.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a great noise of horses and
riders. It seemed to come from Nantes, and all the
women moved spontaneously to protect Baudelot with
their bodies, but his own soldiers appeared to deliver
him. They were in the garden; they forced their way
into the house, crying:</p>

<p>“Baudelot! Baudelot!”</p>

<p>They were astonished enough to find their young
leader, not loaded with irons, but surrounded by handsomely
dressed ladies and himself adorned as they had
never beheld him.</p>

<p>Baudelot’s first question was:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, did you enter the pigeon-house?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer. “That’s where we began,
Captain. Neither you nor the pigeons will find it
again. The pigeon-house is torn down.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Baudelot, drawing his sword, “I
am released from my word. Thanks, my brave
fellows!”</p>

<p>Then he took off his hat.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he said very gently, “receive the humble
gratitude of the captive.”</p>

<p>He asked for a carriage.</p>

<p>“One is already harnessed, Captain,” said one of
his soldiers. “The owner of the house tells us it was
to take you to Nantes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1146">[Pg 1146]</span></p>

<p>Just then Baudelot noticed Hamelin bound with the
fetters he himself had worn.</p>

<p>“Service for service, Captain,” he said; “only, instead
of untying your cords, allow me to cut them.
No one shall wear them again.”</p>

<p>Then, as he saw Eleanor recovering herself, he continued:</p>

<p>“Captain Hamelin, this period of civil war and
spilled blood is too sad for betrothals. One can’t tell
whether there will be prisoners to watch in the morning
or enemies to receive in the evening. Postpone your
marriage, I beg of you. See, your fiancée herself
wishes you to do so. My noble young lady, allow the
poor Chouan to escort you back to your home at
Mailly, will you not?”</p>

<p>And soon all the young Chouans galloped away, rejoicing
to have delivered their Captain, and glorious
in the rising sun. Poor fellows, they had so little
time left, most of them, for the sunshine!</p>

<p>There are men who seem immortal whatever they
do. Baudelot de Dairval was not killed although
he did not leave Vendée for an hour. When his
country was less inundated with blood he married
Eleanor de Mailly, and Captain Hamelin witnessed the
wedding contract.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE MARQUISE</h2>
</div>

<p class="center big1 p2b">BY GEORGE SAND</p>


<p>The Marquise de R—— never said brilliant
things, although it is the fashion in French
fiction to make every old woman sparkle
with wit. Her ignorance was extreme in all matters
which contact with the world had not taught her, and
she had none of that nicety of expression, that exquisite
penetration, that marvelous tact, which belong,
it is said, to women who have seen all the different
phases of life and society; she was blunt, heedless,
and sometimes very cynical. She put to flight every
idea I have formed concerning the noble ladies of the
olden times, yet she was a genuine Marquise and had
seen the Court of Louis XV. But as she was an exceptional
character, do not seek in her history for a
study of the manners of any epoch.</p>

<p>I found much pleasure in the society of the lady.
She seemed to me remarkable for nothing much except
her prodigious memory for the events of her
youth and the masculine lucidity with which she
expressed her reminiscences. For the rest, she was,
like all aged persons, forgetful of recent events and
indifferent to everything in which she had any present
personal concern.</p>

<p>Her beauty had not been of that piquant order,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1150">[Pg 1150]</span>
which, though lacking in splendor and regularity, still
gives pleasure in itself; she was not one of those
women taught to be witty, in order to make as favorable
an impression as those who are so by nature.
The Marquise undoubtedly had had the misfortune
to be beautiful. I have seen her portrait, for, like all
old women, she was vain enough to hang it up for
inspection in her apartments. She was represented
in the character of a huntress nymph, with a low satin
waist painted to imitate tiger-skin, sleeves of antique
lace, bow of sandal-wood, and a crescent of pearl
lighting up her hair. It was an admirable painting,
and, above all, an admirable woman—tall, slender,
dark, with black eyes, austere and noble features, unsmiling,
deep red lips, and hands which, it was said,
had thrown the Princess de Lamballe into despair.
Without lace, satin, or powder, she might indeed have
seemed one of those beautiful, proud nymphs fabled
to appear to mortals in the depth of the forest or upon
the solitary mountain-sides, only to drive them mad
with passion and regret.</p>

<p>Yet the Marquise had made few acquaintances; according
to her own account she had been thought dull
and frivolous. The roués of that time cared less for
the charms of beauty than for the allurements of
coquetry; women infinitely less admired than she had
robbed her of all her adorers, and, strange enough, she
had seemed indifferent to her fate. The little she told
me of her life made me believe that her heart had had
no youth, and that a cold selfishness had paralyzed
all its faculties. Still, her old age was adorned by several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1151">[Pg 1151]</span>
sincere friends, and she gave alms without ostentation.</p>

<p>One evening I found her even more communicative
than usual; there was much of sadness in her voice.
“My child,” she said, “the Vicomte de Larrieux has
just died of the gout. It is a great sorrow to me, for
I have been his friend these sixty years.”</p>

<p>“What was his age?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Eighty-four. I am eighty, but not so infirm as he
was, and I can hope to live longer. <em>N’importe!</em> Several
of my friends have gone this year, and although
I tell myself that I am younger and stronger than any
of them, I can not help being frightened when I see
my contemporaries dropping off around me.”</p>

<p>“And these,” said I, “are the only regrets you feel
for poor Larrieux, a man who worshiped you for
sixty years, who never ceased to complain of your
cruelty, yet never revolted from his allegiance? He
was a model lover: there are no more such men.”</p>

<p>“My dear child,” answered the Marquise, “I see
that you think me cold and heartless. Perhaps you
are right; judge for yourself. I will tell you my whole
history, and, whatever opinion you may have of me, I
shall, at least, not die without having made myself
known to some one.</p>

<p>“When I was sixteen I left St. Cyr, where I had
been educated, to marry the Marquis de R——. He
was fifty, but I dared not complain, for every one congratulated
me on this splendid match, and all my
portionless companions envied my lot.</p>

<p>“I was never very bright, and at that time I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1152">[Pg 1152]</span>
positively stupid; the education of the cloister had
completely benumbed my faculties. I left the convent
with a romantic idea of life and of the world, stupidly
considered a merit in young girls, but which often results
in the misery of their whole lives. As a natural
consequence, the experience brought me by my brief
married life was lodged in so narrow a mind that it
was of no use to me. I learned, not to understand
life, but to doubt myself.</p>

<p>“I was a widow before I was seventeen, and as
soon as I was out of mourning I was surrounded by
suitors. I was then in all the splendor of my beauty,
and it was generally admitted that there was neither
face nor figure that could compare with mine; but my
husband, an old, worn-out, dissipated man, who had
never shown me anything but irony and disdain, and
had married me only to secure an office promised with
my hand, had left me such an aversion to marriage
that I could never be brought to contract new ties. In
my ignorance of life I fancied that all men resembled
him, and that in a second husband I should find
M. de R——’s hard heart, his pitiless irony, and
that insulting coldness which had so deeply humiliated
me.</p>

<p>“This terrible entrance into life had dispelled for me
all the illusions of youth. My heart, which perhaps
was not entirely cold, withdrew into itself and grew
suspicious. I was foolish enough to tell my real feelings
to several women of my acquaintance. They did
not fail to tell what they had learned, and without considering
the doubts and anguish of my heart, boldly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1153">[Pg 1153]</span>
declared that I despised all men. There is nothing
men will resent more readily than this; my lovers soon
learned to despise me, and continued their flatteries
only in the hope of finding an opportunity to hold me
up to ridicule. I saw mockery and treachery written
upon every forehead, and my misanthropy increased
every day. About this time there came to Paris from
the Provinces a man who had neither talent, strength,
nor fascination, but who possessed a frankness and
uprightness of feeling very rare among the people
with whom I lived. This was the Vicomte de Larrieux.
He was soon acknowledged to be my most
favored lover.</p>

<p>“He, poor fellow, loved me sincerely in his soul.
His soul! Had he a soul? He was one of those hard,
prosaic men who have not even the elegance of vice
or the glitter of falsehood. He was struck only by
my beauty; he took no pains to discover my heart.
This was not disdain on his part, it was incapacity.
Had he found in me the power of loving, he would
not have known how to respond to it. I do not think
there ever lived a man more wedded to material things
than poor Larrieux. He ate with delight, and fell
asleep in all the armchairs; the remainder of the time
he took snuff. He was always occupied in satisfying
some appetite. I do not think he had one idea a day.
And yet, my dear friend, will you believe it? I never
had the energy to get rid of him; for sixty years he
was my torment. Constantly offended by my repulses,
yet constantly drawn to me by the very obstacles I
placed in the way of his passion, he had for me the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1154">[Pg 1154]</span>
most faithful, the most undying, the most wearisome
love that ever man felt for woman.”</p>

<p>“I am surprised,” said I, “that in the course of your
life you never met a man capable of understanding
you, and worthy of converting you to real love. Must
we conclude that the men of to-day are superior to
those of other times?”</p>

<p>“That would be a great piece of vanity on your
part,” she answered, smiling. “I have little reason to
speak well of the men of my own time; yet I doubt,
too, whether you have made much progress; but I will
not moralize. The cause of my misfortune was entirely
within myself. I had no tact, no judgment. A
woman as proud as I was should have possessed a superior
character, and should have been able to distinguish
at a glance many of the insipid, false, insignificant
men who surrounded me. I was too ignorant,
too narrow-minded for this. As I lived on I acquired
more judgment and have learned that several of the
objects of my hatred deserved far other feelings.”</p>

<p>“And while you were young,” I rejoined, “were you
never tempted to make a second trial? Was this deep-rooted
aversion never shaken off? It is strange.”</p>

<p>The Marquise was silent, then hastily laying her
gold snuff-box on the table—“I have begun my confession,”
said she, “and I will acknowledge everything.
Listen. Once, and only once, I have loved, with a
love as passionate and indomitable as it was imaginative
and ideal. For you see, my child, you young men
think you understand women, but you know nothing
about them. If many old women of eighty were occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1155">[Pg 1155]</span>
to tell you the history of their loves, you
would perhaps find that the feminine soul contains
sources of good and evil of which you have no idea.
And now, guess what was the rank of the man for
whom I entirely lost my head—I, a Marquise, and
prouder and haughtier than any other.”</p>

<p>“The King of France, or the Dauphin, Louis XIV.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you go on in that manner, it will be three
hours before you come to my lover. I prefer to tell
you at once—he was an actor.”</p>

<p>“A king, notwithstanding, I imagine.”</p>

<p>“The noblest, the most elegant that ever trod the
boards. You are not amazed?”</p>

<p>“Not much. I have heard that such ill-sorted passions
were not rare, even when the prejudices of caste
in France were more powerful than they are to-day.”</p>

<p>“Those ill-sorted passions were not tolerated by the
world, I can assure you. The first time I saw him I
expressed my admiration to the Comtesse de Ferriers,
who happened to be beside me, and she answered: ‘Do
not speak so warmly to any one but me. You would
be cruelly taunted were you suspected of forgetting
that in the eyes of a woman of rank an actor can never
be a man.’</p>

<p>“Madame Ferriers’s words remained in my mind,
I know not why. At the time this contemptuous tone
of hers seemed to me absurd, and this fear of committing
myself a piece of malicious hypocrisy.</p>

<p>“His name was Lelio; he was by birth an Italian, but
spoke French admirably. He may have been thirty-five,
although on the stage he often seemed less than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1156">[Pg 1156]</span>
twenty. He played Corneille; after this he played Racine,
and in both he was admirable.”</p>

<p>“I am surprised,” said I, interrupting the Marquise,
“that his name does not appear in the annals of dramatic
talent.”</p>

<p>“He was never famous,” she answered, “and was
appreciated neither by the court nor the town. I have
heard that he was outrageously hissed when he first
appeared. Afterward he was valued for his feeling,
his fire, and his efforts at correct elocution. He was
tolerated and sometimes applauded, but, on the whole,
he was always considered an actor without taste.</p>

<p>“In those days tragedy was played ‘properly’; it was
necessary to die with taste, to fall gracefully, and to
have an air of good breeding, even in the case of a
blow. Dramatic art was modeled upon the usage of
good society, and the diction and gestures of the actors
were in harmony with the hoops and hair powder,
which even then disfigured ‘Phèdre.’<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I have never
appreciated the defects of this school of art. I bravely
endured it twice in the week, for it was the fashion to
like it; but I listened with so cold and constrained an
air that it was generally said I was insensible to the
charms of fine poetry.</p>

<p>“One evening, after a rather long absence from
Paris, I went to the Comédie Française to see ‘Le Cid.’<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Lelio had been admitted to this theatre during my stay
in the country, and I saw him for the first time. He
played Rodrigue. I was deeply moved by the very
first tone of his voice. It was penetrating rather than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1157">[Pg 1157]</span>
sonorous, but vibrating and strongly accentuated. His
voice was much criticized. That of the Cid was supposed
to be deep and powerful, just as all the heroes
of antiquity were supposed to be tall and strong. A
king who was but five feet six inches could not wear
the diadem; it would have been contrary to the decrees
of tastes. Lelio was small and slender. His
beauty lay not in the features, but in the nobleness of
his forehead, the irresistible grace of his attitude, the
careless ease of his movements, the proud but melancholy
expression of his face. The word charm
should have been invented for him; it belonged to all
his words, to all his glances, to all his motions. It
was indeed a charm which he threw around me. This
man, who stepped, spoke, moved without system or
affectation, who sobbed with his heart as much as
with his voice, who forgot himself to become identified
with his passion; this man in whom the body
seemed wasted and shattered by the soul, and a single
one of whose glances contained all the life I failed to
find in real life, exercised over me a really magnetic
power. I alone could follow and understand him,
and he was for five years my king, my life, my love.
To me he was much more than a man. His was an
intellectual power which formed my soul at its will.
Soon I was unable to conceal the impression he made
on me. I gave up my box at the Comédie Française
in order not to betray myself. I pretended I had
become pious, and in the evening I went to pray in
the churches; instead of that I dressed myself as a
working woman and mingled with the common people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1158">[Pg 1158]</span>
that I might listen to him unconstrained. At last I
bribed one of the employees of the theatre to let me
occupy a little corner where no one could see me
and which I reached by a side corridor. As an additional
precaution I dressed myself as a schoolboy.
When the hour for the theatre sounded in the large
clock in my drawing-room I was seized with violent
palpitations. While my carriage was getting ready
I tried to control myself; and if Larrieux happened
to be with me I was rude to him, and threatened to
send him away. I must have had great dissimulation
and great tact to have hidden all this for five years
from Larrieux, the most jealous of men, and from all
the malicious people about me.</p>

<p>“I must tell you that instead of struggling against
this passion I yielded to it with eagerness, with delight.
It was so pure! Why should I have blushed
for it? It gave me new life; it initiated me into all
the feelings I had wished to experience; it almost
made me a woman. I was proud to feel myself thrill
and tremble. The first time my dormant heart beat
aloud was to me a triumph. I learned to pout, to
love, to be faithful and capricious. It was remarked
I grew handsomer every day, that my dark eyes
softened, that my smile was more expressive, that
what I said was truer and had more meaning than
could have been expected.</p>

<p>“I have just told you that when I heard the clock
strike I trembled with joy and impatience. Even now
I seem to feel the delicious oppression which used
to overwhelm me at the sound of that clock. Since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1159">[Pg 1159]</span>
then, through the vicissitudes of fortune, I have come
to find myself very happy in the possession of a few
small rooms in the Marais. Well, of all my magnificent
house, my aristocratic <em>faubourg</em>, and my past
splendor I regret only that which could have recalled
to me those days of love and dreams. I have saved
from the general ruin a few pieces of furniture which
I look upon with as much emotion as if the hour for
the theatre were about to strike now, and my horses
were pawing at the door. Oh! my child, never love
as I loved; it is a storm which death alone can quell.</p>

<p>“Then I learned to take pleasure in being young,
wealthy, and beautiful. Seated in my coach, my feet
buried in furs, I could see myself reflected in the
mirror in front of me. The dress of that time, which
has since been so laughed at, was of extraordinary
richness and splendor. When arranged with taste and
modified in its exaggeration, it endowed a beautiful
woman with dignity, with a softness, the grace of
which the portraits of that time could give you no
idea. A woman, clothed in its panoply of feathers,
of silks, and flowers, was obliged to move slowly. I
have seen very fair women in white robes with long
trains of watered silk, their hair powdered and dressed
with white plumes, who might without exaggeration
have been compared to swans. Despite all Rousseau
has said, those enormous folds of satin, that profusion
of muslin which enveloped a slender little body as
down envelops a dove, made us resemble birds, rather
than wasps. Long wings of lace fell from our arms,
and our ribbons, purses, and jewels were variegated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1160">[Pg 1160]</span>
with the most brilliant colors. Balancing ourselves
in our little high-heeled shoes, we seemed to fear to
touch the earth and walked with the disdainful circumspection
of a little bird on the edge of a brook.</p>

<p>“At the time of which I am speaking blond powder
began to be worn and gave the hair a light and soft
color. This method of modifying the crude shades of
the hair gave softness to the face, and an extraordinary
brilliance to the eyes. The forehead was completely
uncovered, its outline melted insensibly into
the pale shades of the hair. It thus appeared higher
and prouder, and gave all women a majestic air. It
was the fashion, too, to dress the hair low, with large
curls thrown back and falling on the neck. This was
very becoming to me, and I was celebrated for the
taste and magnificence of my dress. I sometimes wore
red velvet with grebe-skin, sometimes white satin
edged with tiger-skin, sometimes lilac damask shot
with silver, with white feathers and pearls in my hair.
Thus attired I would pay a few visits until the hour
for the second piece at the theatre, for Lelio never
came on in the first. I created a sensation wherever
I appeared, and, when I again found myself in my
carriage, I contemplated with much pleasure the reflected
image of the woman who loved Lelio, and
might have been loved by him. Until then, the only
pleasure I had found in being beautiful lay in the
jealousy I excited. But from the moment that I loved
I began to enjoy my beauty for its own sake. It was
all I had to offer Lelio as a compensation for the triumphs
which were denied him in Paris, and I loved to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1161">[Pg 1161]</span>
think of the pride and joy this poor actor, so misjudged,
so laughed at, would feel were he told that
the Marquise de R—— had dedicated her heart to him.
These the dreams, however, were as brief as they were
beautiful. As soon as my thoughts assumed some
consistency, as soon as they took the form of any plan
whatever, I had the fortitude to suppress them, and
all the pride of rank reasserted its empire over my
soul. You seem surprised at this. I will explain it by
and by.</p>

<p>“About eight o’clock my carriage stopped at the
little Church of the Carmelites near the Luxembourg,
and I sent it away, for I was supposed to be attending
the religious lectures which were given there at that
hour. But I only crossed the church and the garden
and came out on the other street. I went to the garret
of the young needlewoman named Florence, who
was devoted to me. I locked myself up in her room,
and joyfully laid aside all my adornments to don the
black square-cut coat, the sword and wig of a young
college professor. Tall, with my dark complexion and
inoffensive glances, I really had the awkward hypocritical
look of a little priestling who had stolen in to
see the play. I took a hackney coach, and hastened
to hide myself in my little box at the theatre. Then
my joy, my terror, my trembling ceased. A profound
calm came upon me and I remained until the raising
of the curtain as if absorbed in expectation of some
great solemnity.</p>

<p>“As the vulture in his hypnotic circling surrounds
the partridge and holds him panting and motionless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1162">[Pg 1162]</span>
so did the soul of Lelio, that great soul of a poet and
tragedian, envelop all my faculties, and plunge me into
a torpor of admiration. I listened, my hands clasped
upon my knees and my chin upon the front of the box,
and my forehead bathed in perspiration; I hardly
breathed; the crude light of the lamps tortured my
eyes, which, tired and burning, were fastened on his
every gesture, his every step. His feigned motions,
his simulated misfortune, impressed me as if they were
real. I could hardly distinguish between truth and
illusion. To me, Lelio was indeed Rodrigue, Bajazet,
Hippolyte. I hated his enemies. I trembled at his
dangers; his sorrows drew from me floods of tears,
and when he died I was compelled to stifle my emotions
in my handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Between the acts I sat down at the back of my
box; I was as one dead until the meagre tone of the
orchestra warned me that the curtain was about to
rise again. Then I sprang up, full of strength and
ardor, the power to feel, to weep. How much freshness,
poetry, and youth there was in that man’s talent!
That whole generation must have been of ice not to
have fallen at his feet.</p>

<p>“And yet, although he offended every conventional
idea, although he could not adapt his taste to that
silly public, although he scandalized the women by the
carelessness of his dress and deportment, and displeased
the men by his contempt for their foolish actions,
there were moments when, by an irresistible
fascination, by the power of his eye and his voice, he
held the whole of this ungrateful public as if in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1163">[Pg 1163]</span>
hollow of his hand, and compelled it to applaud and
tremble. This happened but seldom, for the entire
spirit of the age can not be suddenly changed; but
when it did happen, the applause was frantic. It
seemed as if the Parisians, subjugated by his genius,
wished to atone for all their injustice. As for me, I
believed that this man had at most a supernatural
power, and that those who most bitterly despised him
were compelled to swell his triumph in spite of themselves.
In truth, at such times the Comédie Française
seemed smitten with madness, and the spectators, on
leaving the theatre, were amazed to remember that
they had applauded Lelio. As for me, I seized the
opportunity to give full play to my emotion; I shouted,
I wept, I passionately called his name. Happily for
me, my weak voice was drowned in the storm which
raged about me.</p>

<p>“At other times he was hissed when he seemed to
me to be sublime, and then I left the theatre, my heart
full of rage. Those nights were the most dangerous
for me. I was violently tempted to seek him out, to
weep with him, to curse the age in which we lived, and
to console him by offering him my enthusiasm and
love.</p>

<p>“One evening as I left the theatre by the side passage
which led to my box, a small, slender man passed
in front of me, and turned into the street. One of the
stage-carpenters took off his hat and said: ‘Good evening,
Monsieur Lelio.’ Eager to obtain a nearer view
of this extraordinary man, I ran after him, crossed the
street, and, forgetting the danger to which I exposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1164">[Pg 1164]</span>
myself, followed him into a café. Fortunately, it was
not one in which I was likely to meet any one of my
own rank.</p>

<p>“When, by the light of the smoky lamp, I looked at
Lelio, I thought I had been mistaken and had followed
another man. He was at least thirty-five, sallow,
withered, and worn out. He was badly dressed,
he looked vulgar, spoke in a hoarse, broken voice,
shook hands with the meanest wretches, drank brandy,
and swore horribly. It was not until I had heard his
name repeated several times that I felt sure that this
was the divinity of the theatre, interpreter of the great
Corneille. I could recognize none of those charms
which had so fascinated me, not even his glance, so
bright, so ardent, and so sad. His eyes were dull,
dead, almost stupid; his strongly accentuated pronunciation
seemed ignoble when he called to the
waiter, or talked of gambling and taverns. He walked
badly, he looked vulgar, and the paint was only half
wiped from his cheeks. It was no longer Hippolyte—it
was Lelio. The temple was empty; the oracle was
dumb; the divinity had become a man, not even a man—an
actor.</p>

<p>“He went out, and I sat stupefied without even presence
of mind enough to drink the hot spiced wine I
had called for. When I remembered where I was, and
perceived the insulting glances which were heaped
upon me, I became frightened. It was the first time
I had ever found myself in such an equivocal position,
and in such immediate contact with people of that
class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1165">[Pg 1165]</span></p>

<p>“I rose and tried to escape, but forgot to pay my
reckoning. The waiter ran after me; I was terribly
ashamed; I was obliged to return, enter into explanations
at the desk, and endure all the mocking and suspicious
looks which were turned upon me. When I
left I thought I was followed. In vain I looked for
a hackney-coach; there were none remaining in front
of the theatre. I constantly heard heavy steps echoing
my own. Trembling, I turned my head, and recognized
a tall, ill-looking fellow whom I had noticed in
one corner of the café, and who had very much the
air of a spy or something worse. He spoke to me; I
do not know what he said; I was too much frightened
to hear, but I had still presence of mind enough to rid
myself of him. I struck him in the face with my cane,
and, leaving him stunned at my audacity, I shot away
swift as an arrow, and did not stop till I reached Florence’s
little garret. When I awoke the next morning
in my own bed with its wadded curtains and coronal
of pink feathers, I almost thought I had dreamed, and
felt greatly mortified when I recollected the disillusions
of the previous night. I thought myself thoroughly
cured of my love, and I tried to rejoice at it,
but in vain. I was filled with a mortal regret, the
weariness of life again entered my heart, the world
had not a pleasure which could charm me.</p>

<p>“Evening came, but brought no more beneficial emotions.
Society seemed to me stupid. I went to church
and listened to the evening lecture with a determination
of becoming pious; I caught cold, and came home
quite ill. I remained in bed several days. The Comtesse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1166">[Pg 1166]</span>
de Ferrières came to see me, assured me that I
had no fever, that lying still made me ill, that I must
amuse myself, go out, go to the theatre. She compelled
me to go with her to see ‘Cinna.’<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> ‘You no
longer go to the theatre,’ said she to me; ‘your health
is undermined by your piety, and the dulness of your
life. You have not seen Lelio for some time; he has
improved, and he is now sometimes applauded. I
think he may some day become very tolerable.’</p>

<p>“I do not know why I allowed myself to be persuaded.
However, as I was completely disenchanted
with Lelio, I thought I no longer ran any risk in
braving his fascinations in public. I dressed myself
with excessive brilliance, and, in a court proscenium
box, fronted a danger in which I no longer believed.</p>

<p>“But the danger was never more imminent. Lelio
was sublime, and I had never been more in love with
him. My recent adventure seemed but a dream. I
could not believe that Lelio was other than he seemed
upon the stage. In spite of myself, I yielded to the
terrible agitations into which he had the power of
throwing me. My face was bathed in tears, and I
was compelled to cover it with my handkerchief. In
the disorder of my mind I wiped off my rouge and my
patches, and the Comtesse de Ferrières advised me to
retire to the back of my box, for my emotion was
creating a sensation in the house. I fortunately had
had the skill to make every one believe it was the playing
of Mdlle. Hippolyte Clairon which affected me so
deeply. She was, in my own opinion, a very cold and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1167">[Pg 1167]</span>formal actress, too superior perhaps for her profession,
as it was then understood; but her manner of
saying ‘Tout beau,’ in ‘Cinna,’ had given her a great
reputation. It must be said, however, that when she
played with Lelio she outdid herself. Although she
took pains to proclaim her share in the fashionable
contempt for his method of acting, she assuredly felt
the influence of his genius.</p>

<p>“That evening Lelio noticed me, either on account
of my dress or my emotion; for I saw him, when he
was not acting, bend over one of the spectators, who,
at that epoch, sat upon the stage, and inquire my name.
I guessed his question by the way both looked at me.
My heart beat almost to suffocation, and I noticed
during the play that Lelio’s eyes turned several times
toward me. What would I not have given to hear
what the Chevalier de Bretillac, whom he had questioned,
had said to him about me! Lelio’s face did
not indicate the nature of the information he had received,
for he was obliged to retain the expression
suited to his part. I knew this Bretillac very slightly,
and I could not imagine whether he would speak well
or ill of me.</p>

<p>“That night I understood for the first time the
nature of the passion which enchained me to Lelio. It
was a passion purely intellectual, purely ideal. It was
not he I loved, but those heroes of ancient times
whose sincerity, whose fidelity, whose tenderness he
knew how to portray; with him and by him I was carried
back to an epoch of forgotten virtues. I was
bright enough to think that in those days I should not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1168">[Pg 1168]</span>
have been misjudged and hated, and that I should not
have been reduced to loving a fantom of the footlights.
Lelio was to me but the shadow of the Cid, the representative
of that antique chivalric love now ridiculed
in France. My Lelio was a fictitious being who
had no existence outside the theatre. The illusions of
the stage, the glare of the footlights, were a part of
the being whom I loved. Without them he was nothing
to me, and faded like a story before the brightness
of day. I had no desire to see him off the boards;
and should have been in despair had I met him. It
would have been like contemplating the ashes of a
great man.</p>

<p>“One evening as I was going to the Carmelite
church with the intention of leaving it by the passage
door, I perceived that I was followed, and became
convinced that henceforth it would be almost impossible
to conceal the object of my nocturnal expeditions.
I decided to go publicly to the theatre. Lelio saw
me and watched me; my beauty had struck him, my
sensibility flattered him. His attention sometimes
wandered so much as to displease the public. Soon
I could no longer doubt. He was madly in love
with me.</p>

<p>“My box had pleased the Princess de Vaudemont.
I gave it up to her, and took for myself a smaller one,
less in view of the house and better situated. I was
almost upon the stage, I did not lose one of Lelio’s
glances; and he could look at me without its being
seen by the public. But I no longer needed to catch
his eye in order to understand all his feelings. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1169">[Pg 1169]</span>
sound of his voice, his sighs, the expression which he
gave to certain verses, certain words, told me that he
was speaking to me. I was the happiest and proudest
of women, for then it was the hero, not the actor,
who loved me.</p>

<p>“I have since heard that Lelio often followed me in
my walks and drives; so little did I desire to see him
outside of the theatre that I never perceived it. Of
the eighty years I have passed in this world, those
five are the only ones in which I really lived.</p>

<p>“One day I read in the ‘Mercure de France’ the
name of a new actor engaged at the Comédie
Française to replace Lelio, who was about to leave
France.</p>

<p>“This announcement was a mortal blow to me. I
could not conceive how I should exist when deprived
of these emotions, this life of passion and storm. This
event gave an immense development to my love, and
was well-nigh my ruin.</p>

<p>“I no longer struggled with myself; I no longer
sought to stifle all thoughts contrary to the dignity
of my rank. I regretted that he was not what he
appeared on the stage; I wished him as young and
handsome as he seemed each night before the footlights,
that I might sacrifice to him all my pride, all
my prejudices.</p>

<p>“While I was in this state of irresolution, I received
a letter in an unknown hand. It is the only
love letter I have ever kept. Though Larrieux has
written me innumerable protestations, and I have received
a thousand perfumed declarations from a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1170">[Pg 1170]</span>
others, it is the only real love letter that was
ever sent me.”</p>

<p>The Marquise rose, opened with a steady hand an
inlaid casket, and took from it a crumpled, worn-out
letter, which I read with difficulty.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madame</span>—I am certain you will feel nothing but
contempt for this letter, you will not even deem it
worthy of your anger. But, to a man falling into an
abyss, what matters one more stone at the bottom?
You will think me mad, and you will be right. You
will perhaps pity me, for you will not doubt my sincerity.
However humble your piety may have made
you, you will understand the extent of my despair;
you must already know <em>how much evil and how much
good your eyes can do</em>....</p>

<p>“You must know this already, madame; it is impossible
that the violent emotions I have portrayed
upon the stage, my cries of wrath and despair, have
not twenty times revealed to you my passion. You
can not have lighted all these flames without being
conscious of what you did. Perhaps you played with
me as a tiger with his prey; perhaps the spectacle of
my folly and my tortures was your pastime. But no;
to think so were to presume too much. No, madame,
I do not believe it; you never thought of me. You
felt the verses of the great Corneille, you identified
these with the noble passions of tragedy; that was all.
And I, madman that I was, I dared to think that my
voice alone sometimes awoke your sympathies, that
my heart echoed in yours, that between you and me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1171">[Pg 1171]</span>
there was something more than between me and the
public. Oh, my madness was arrant, but it was sweet!
Leave me my illusions, madame; what are they to
you? Do you fear that I should boast of them? By
what right should I do so, and who would believe me?
I should only make myself a laughing-stock of sensible
people. Leave me this conviction; it has given
me more joy than the severity of the public has caused
me sorrow. Let me bless you, let me thank you upon
my knees, for the sensibility which I have discovered
in your soul, and which no one else has ever shown
me; for the tears which I have seen you shed for my
fictitious sorrows, and which have often raised my inspiration
almost to delirium; for the timid glances
which sought, at least it seemed so, to console me for
the coldness of my audience. Oh, why were you born
to pomp and splendor! Why am I an obscure and
nameless artist! Why have I not riches and the favor
of the public, that I might exchange them for a name,
for one of those titles which I have hitherto disdained,
and which, perhaps, would permit me to aspire as high
as you are placed! Once I deemed the distinctions
conferred upon talent superior to all others. To what
purpose, thought I, is a man a Chevalier or a Marquis
but to be the sillier, the vainer, and the more insolent?
I hated the pride of men of rank, and thought that I
should be sufficiently avenged for their disdain if my
genius raised me above them. Dreams and delusions
all! My strength has not equaled my mad ambition.
I have remained obscure; I have done worse—I have
touched success, and allowed it to escape me. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1172">[Pg 1172]</span>
thought myself great, and I was cast down to the
dust; I imagined that I was almost sublime, and I
was condemned to be ridiculous. Fate took me—me
and my audacious dreams—and crushed me as if I had
been a reed! I am a most wretched man! But I committed
my greatest folly when I cast my eyes beyond
that row of lights which marked between me and the
rest of society an invisible line of separation. It is
to me a circle of Popilius. I, an actor, I dared to raise
my eyes and fasten them upon a beautiful woman—upon
a woman, young, lovely, and of high rank; for
you are all this, madame, and I know it. The world
accuses you of coldness and of exaggerated piety. I
alone understand you. Your first smile, your first
tear, sufficiently disproved the absurd fable which
Chevalier de Bretillac repeated against you.</p>

<p>“But then what a destiny is yours! What fatality
weighs upon you as upon me, that in the midst of
society so brilliant, which calls itself so enlightened,
you should have found only the heart of a poor actor
to do you justice. Nothing will deprive me of the
sad and consoling thought that, had we been born in
the same rank, you would have been mine in spite of
my rivals, in spite of my inferiority. You would have
been compelled to acknowledge that there is in me
something greater than their wealth, and their titles—the
power of loving you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lelio.</span>”
</p>
</div>

<p>“This letter,” continued the Marquise, “was of a
character very unusual at the time it was written, and
seemed to me, notwithstanding some passages of theatrical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1173">[Pg 1173]</span>
declamation at the beginning, so powerful, so
true, so full of only bold passion, that I was overwhelmed
by it. The pride which still struggled within
me faded away. I would have given all the remaining
days I had to live one hour of such love.</p>

<p>“I answered in these words, as nearly as I can
remember:</p>

<p>“‘I do not accuse you, Lelio; I accuse destiny. I do
not pity you alone; I pity myself also. Neither pride
nor prudence shall make me deny you the consolation
of believing that I have felt a preference for you.
Keep it, for it is the only one I can offer you. I can
never consent to see you.’</p>

<p>“Next day I received a note which I hastily read and
threw into the fire, to prevent Larrieux from seeing it,
for he came suddenly upon me while I was reading it.
It read thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Madame</span>—I must see you or I must die. Once—once
only, but for a single hour, if such is your will.
Why should you fear an interview since you trust my
honor and my prudence. Madame, I know who you
are; I am well aware of your piety and of the austerity
of your life. I am not fool enough to hope for
anything but a word of compassion, but it must fall
from your own lips. My heart must receive it and
bear it away, or my heart must break.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Lelio.</span>’<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“I believed implicitly in the humility, in the sincerity
of Lelio. Besides, I had ample reason to trust my own
strength. I resolved to see him. I had completely forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1174">[Pg 1174]</span>
his faded features, his low-bred manners, his
vulgar aspect; I recollected only the fascination of his
genius, his letters, and his love. I answered:</p>

<p>“‘I will see you. Find some secure place, but hope
for nothing but for what you have asked. Should you
seek to abuse my trust, you would be a villain, and I
should not fear you.’</p>

<p>“Answer:</p>

<p>“‘Your trust would save you from the basest of
villains. You will see, Madame, that Lelio is not unworthy
of it. Duke —— has often been good enough
to offer me the use of his house in the Rue de Valois.
Deign to go thither after the play.’</p>

<p>“Some explanations and directions as to the locality
of the house followed. I received this note at four
o’clock. The whole negotiation had occupied but a
day. I had spent it in wandering through the house
like one distracted; I was in a fever. This rapid succession
of events bore me along as in a dream.</p>

<p>“When I had made the final decision, when it was
impossible to draw back, I sank down upon my ottoman,
breathless and dizzy.</p>

<p>“I was really ill. A surgeon was sent for; I was
bled. I told my servants not to mention my indisposition
to any one; I dreaded the intrusion of officious
advisers, and was determined not to be prevented from
going out that night.</p>

<p>“I threw myself upon my bed to await the appointed
hour, and gave orders that no visitors should be admitted.
The blood-letting had relieved and weakened
me; I sank into a great depression of spirits. All my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1175">[Pg 1175]</span>
illusions vanished with the excitement which had accompanied
my fever. Reason and memory returned;
I remembered my disenchantment in the coffee-house,
and Lelio’s wretched appearance there; I prepared to
blush for my folly, and to fall from the height of my
deceitful visions to a bare and despicable reality. I
no longer understood how it had been possible for me
to consent to exchange my heroic and romantic tenderness
for the revulsion of feeling which awaited me,
and the sense of shame which would henceforth poison
all my recollections. I bitterly regretted what I had
done; I wept my illusions, my love, and that future of
pure and secret joys which I was about to forfeit.
Above all, I mourned for Lelio, whom in seeing I
should forever lose, in whose love I had found five
years of happiness, and for whom in a few hours I
should feel nothing but indifference.</p>

<p>“In the paroxysm of my grief I violently wrung
my arms; the vein reopened, and I had barely time to
ring for my maid, who found me in a swoon in my
bed. A deep and heavy sleep, against which I struggled
in vain, seized me. I neither dreamed nor suffered;
I was as one dead for several hours. When I
again opened my eyes my room was almost dark, my
house silent; my waiting-woman was asleep in a chair
at the foot of my bed. I remained for some time in
such a state of numbness and weakness that I recollected
nothing. Suddenly my memory returned, and
I asked myself whether the hour and the day of rendezvous
were passed, whether I had slept an hour or
a century; whether I had killed Lelio by breaking my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1176">[Pg 1176]</span>
word. Was there yet time? I tried to rise, but my
strength failed me. I struggled for some moments as
if in a nightmare. At last I summoned all the forces
of my will. I sprang to the floor, opened the curtains,
and saw the moon shining upon the trees of my garden.
I ran to the clock; the hands marked ten. I
seized my maid and waked her: ‘Quinette, what day of
the week is it?’ She sprang from her chair, screaming,
and tried to escape from me, for she thought me
delirious; I reassured her and learned that I had only
slept three hours. I thanked God. I asked for a
hackney-coach. Quinette looked at me in amazement.
At last she became convinced that I had the full use
of my senses, transmitted my order, and began to
dress me.</p>

<p>“I asked for my simplest dress; I put no ornaments
in my hair, I refused to wear my rouge. I wished
above all things for Lelio’s esteem and respect, for
they were far more precious to me than his love.
Nevertheless, I was pleased when Quinette, who was
much surprised at this new caprice, said, examining
me from head to foot: ‘Truly, madame, I know not
how you manage it. You are dressed in a plain white
robe, without either train or pannier; you are ill and
as pale as death; you have not even put on a patch;
yet I never saw you so beautiful as to-night. I pity
the men who will look upon you!’ ‘Do you think me
so very austere, my poor Quinette?’ ‘Alas, madame,
every day I pray Heaven to make me like you; but
up to this time—’ ‘Come, simpleton, give me my
mantle and muff.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1177">[Pg 1177]</span></p>

<p>“At midnight I was in the house of the Rue de
Valois. I was carefully veiled, a sort of valet de
chambre received me; he was the only human being
to be seen in this mysterious dwelling. He led me
through the windings of a dark garden to a pavilion
buried in silence and shadow. Depositing his green
silk lantern in the vestibule, he opened the door of a
large dusky room, showed me by a respectful gesture
and with a most impassive face a ray of light proceeding
from the other extremity, and said, in a tone so
low that it seemed as if he feared to awaken the sleeping
echoes: ‘Your ladyship is alone, no one else has
yet come. Your ladyship will find in the summer parlor
a bell which I will answer if you need anything.’
He disappeared as if by enchantment, shutting the
door upon me.</p>

<p>“I was terribly frightened; I thought I had fallen
into some trap. I called him back. He instantly reappeared,
and his air of stupid solemnity reassured
me. I asked him what time it was, although I knew
perfectly well, for I had sounded my watch twenty
times in the carriage. ‘It is midnight,’ answered he,
without raising his eyes. I now resolutely entered the
summer parlor, and I realized how unfounded were
my fears when I saw that the doors which opened
upon the garden were only of painted silk. Nothing
could be more charming than this boudoir; it was fitted
up as a concert-room. The walls were of stucco as
white as snow, and the mirrors were framed in unpolished
silver. Musical instruments of unusually rich
material were scattered about, upon seats of white velvet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1178">[Pg 1178]</span>
trimmed with pearls. The light came from above
through leaves of alabaster, which formed a dome.
This soft, even light might have been mistaken for
that of the moon. A single statue of white marble
stood in the middle of the room; it was an antique
and represented Isis veiled, with her finger upon her
lips. The mirrors which reflected us, both pale and
draped in white, produced such an illusion upon me
that I was obliged to distinguish my finger from hers.</p>

<p>“Suddenly the silence was interrupted; the door was
opened and closed, and light footsteps sounded upon
the floor. I sank into a chair more dead than alive,
for I was about to see Lelio shorn of the illusions of
the stage. I closed my eyes, and inwardly bade them
farewell before I reopened them.</p>

<p>“But how much was I surprised! Lelio was beautiful
as an angel. He had not taken off his stage dress,
and it was the most elegant I had ever seen him wear.
His Spanish doublet was of white satin, his shoulder
and garter knots of cherry ribbons, and a short cloak
of the same color was thrown over his shoulder. He
wore an immense ruff of English lace; his hair was
short and unpowdered, partially covered by a cap with
white feathers and a diamond rose. In this costume
he had just played Don Juan in ‘Festin de Pierre.’
Never had I seen him so beautiful, so young, so poetical,
as at that moment. Velasquez would have worshiped
such a model.</p>

<p>“He knelt before me. I could not help stretching
out my hand to him, he seemed so submissive, so fearful
of displeasing me. A man sufficiently in love to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1179">[Pg 1179]</span>
tremble before a woman was rare in those times, and
this one was thirty-five and an actor.</p>

<p>“It seemed to me then, it seems to me still, that he
was in the first bloom of youth. In his white dress
he looked like a young page; his forehead had all the
purity, his heart all the ardor of a first love. He took
my hands and covered them with kisses. My senses
seemed to desert me; I caressed his burning forehead,
his stiff, black hair, and the brown neck which disappeared
in the soft whiteness of his collar. He wept
like a woman; I was overwhelmed with surprise.</p>

<p>“I wept delicious tears. I compelled him to raise
his head and look at me. How splendid, how tender
were his eyes! How much fascination his warm, true
soul communicated to the very defects of his face, and
the scars left upon it by time and toil! When I saw
the premature wrinkles upon his beautiful forehead,
when I saw the pallor of his lips, the languor of his
smile, my heart was melted. I felt that I must needs
weep for his griefs, his disappointments, the labors of
his life. I identified myself with him in all his sorrows,
even that of his long, hopeless love for me, and
I had but one wish—to compensate him for the ills he
had suffered.</p>

<p>“My dear Lelio, my great Rodrigue, my beautiful
Don Juan! He spoke to me, he told me how from a
dissipated actor I had made him a man full of life and
ardor; how I had raised him in his own eyes, and restored
to him the illusions of his youth; he spoke of
his respect, his veneration for me, of his contempt for
the species of love which was then in fashion. Never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1180">[Pg 1180]</span>
did a man with more penetrating eloquence speak to
the heart of a woman; never did Racine make love
utter itself with such conviction of its own truth, such
poetry, such strength. Everything elevated and profound,
everything sweet and fiery which passion can
inspire, lay in his words, his face, his eyes, his caresses.
Alas! did he deceive himself! Was he playing
a part?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do not think so,” I cried, looking at
the Marquise. She seemed to grow young as she
spoke; and, like the fairy Urgela, to cast off her hundred
years. I know not who has said that a woman’s
heart has no wrinkles.</p>

<p>“Listen to the end,” said she. “I threw my arms
around his neck; I shivered as I touched the satin of
his coat, as I breathed the perfume of his hair. My
emotion was too violent and I fainted.</p>

<p>“He recalled me to myself by his prompt assistance.
I found him still kneeling at my feet. ‘Pity
me, kill me,’ cried he. He was paler and far more
ill than I.</p>

<p>“‘Listen, Lelio,’ said I. ‘Here we separate forever,
but let us carry from this place a whole future of
blissful thoughts and adored memories. I swear,
Lelio, to love you till my death. I swear it without
fear, for I feel that the snows of age will not have
the power to extinguish this ardent flame.’ Lelio
knelt before me; he did not implore me, he did not
reproach me; he said that he had not hoped for so
much happiness as I had given him, and that he had
no right to ask for more. Nevertheless, as he bade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1181">[Pg 1181]</span>
me farewell, his despair, the emotion which trembled
in his face, terrified me. I asked him if he would not
find happiness in thinking of me, if the ecstasy of our
meeting would not lend its charm to all the days of his
life, if his past and future sorrows would not be softened
each time he recalled it. He roused himself to
promise, to swear all I asked. He again fell at my
feet and passionately kissed my dress. I made a
sign and he left me. The carriage I had sent for
came.</p>

<p>“The automatic servant of the house knocked three
times outside to warn me. Lelio despairingly threw
himself in front of the door: he looked like a spectre.
I gently repulsed him and he yielded. I crossed the
threshold, and as he attempted to follow me, I showed
him a chair in the middle of the room, underneath the
statue of Isis. He sat down in it. A passionate smile
wandered over his lips, his eyes sent out one more
flash of gratitude and love. He was still beautiful,
still young, still a grandee of Spain. After a few
steps, when I was about to lose him forever, I turned
back and looked at him once more. Despair had
crushed him. He was old, altered, frightful. His
body seemed paralyzed. His stiffened lips attempted
an unmeaning smile. His eyes were glassy and dim;
he was now only Lelio, the shadow of a lover and a
prince.”</p>

<p>The Marquise paused; then, while her aspect
changed like that of a ruin which totters and sinks,
she added: “Since then I have not heard him mentioned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1182">[Pg 1182]</span></p>

<p>The Marquise made a second and a longer pause;
then, with the terrible fortitude which comes with
length of years, which springs from the persistent
love of life or the near hope of death, she said with
a smile: “Well, do you not now believe in the ideality
of the eighteenth century?”</p>

<p><em>Alfred de Musset, the great poet of love,
the most spontaneous, sincere, moving, spiritual,
ironic, lucid, impertinent, disdainful of
rime, was born at Paris in 1810. He was a
dandy, the spoiled child of the Romantic movement,
with a voluptuous and sombre imagination.
But he made a too great sacrifice to
fashion and so-called Byronism when he wrote
“Rolla.” The crisis of his life came when, with a
broken heart, he returned to Paris in 1833, leaving
George Sand at Venice. Not until then
did he produce his poetical masterpieces, “La
Nuit de Mai,” etc., and his prose romance, “The
Confession of a Child of the Age,” and those
exquisite little theatrical pieces not intended
for the theatre, such as “The Chandelier,” etc.</em></p>

<p><em>Later, in his “Letters of Dupin and Cotinet,”
which he wrote for the “Revue des
Deux Mondes,” De Musset broke with Romanticism.
He died at Paris in 1857.</em></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>In 1756, when Louis XV, wearied with the quarrels
between the magistrature and the grand
council, about the “two sous tax,”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> determined
upon holding a special <em>lit de justice</em>, the members of
Parliament resigned. Sixteen of these resignations
were accepted, and as many exiles decreed. “But,”
said Madame de Pompadour to one of the presidents,
“could you calmly stand by and see a handful of men
resist the authority of the King of France? Would
you not have a very bad opinion of such a policy?
Throw off the cloak of petty pretense, M. le President,
and you will see the situation just as I see it
myself.”</p>


<p>It was not only the exiles that had to pay the penalty
of their want of compliance, but also their relatives
and friends. The violation of mail-secrets was
one of the King’s amusements. To relieve the monotony
of his other pleasures, it pleased him to hear his
favorite read all the curious things that were to be
found in his subjects’ private correspondence. Of
course, under the fallacious pretext of doing his own
detective work, he reaped a large harvest of enjoyment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1186">[Pg 1186]</span>
from the thousand little intrigues which thus
passed under his eyes; but whoever was connected,
whether closely or in a remote degree, with the
leaders of the factions, was almost invariably ruined.</p>

<p>Every one knows that Louis XV, with all his manifold
weaknesses, had one, and only one, strong point:
he was inexorable.</p>

<p>One evening, as he sat before the fire with his feet
on the mantelpiece, melancholy as was his wont, the
marquise, looking through a packet of letters, suddenly
burst into a laugh and shrugged her shoulders.
The King wished to know what was the matter.</p>

<p>“Why, I have found here,” answered she, “a letter,
without a grain of common sense in it, but a
very touching thing for all that—quite pitiable in
fact.”</p>

<p>“Whose is the signature?” said the King.</p>

<p>“There is none, it is a love-letter.”</p>

<p>“And what is the address?”</p>

<p>“That is just the point. It is addressed to Mademoiselle
d’Annebault, the niece of my good friend,
Madame d’Estrades. Apparently it has been put in
among these papers on purpose for me to see.”</p>

<p>“And what is there in it?” the King persisted.</p>

<p>“Why, I tell you it is all about love. There is mention
also of Vauvert and of Neauflette. Are there
any gentlemen in those parts? Does your Majesty
know of any?”</p>

<p>The King always prided himself upon knowing
France by heart, that is, the nobility of France. The
etiquette of his court, which he had studied thoroughly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1187">[Pg 1187]</span>
was not more familiar to him than the armorial
bearings of his realm. Not a very wide range of
learning; still nothing beyond it did he reckon worthy
the study; and it was a point of vanity with him, the
social hierarchy being, in his eyes, something like the
marble staircase of his palace; he must set foot on it
as sole lord and master. After having pondered a few
moments, he knitted his brow, as though struck by an
unwelcome remembrance; then, with a sign to the
marquise to read, he threw himself back in his easy
chair, saying with a smile:</p>

<p>“Read on—she is a pretty girl.”</p>

<p>Madame de Pompadour assumed her sweetest tone
of raillery and began to read a long letter, which, from
beginning to end, was one rhapsody of love.</p>

<p>“Just see,” said the writer, “how the fates persecute
me! At first everything seemed to work for the
fulfilment of my wishes, and you yourself, my sweet
one, had you not given me reason to hope for happiness?
I must, however, renounce this heavenly dream,
and that for no fault of mine. Is it not an excess of
cruelty to have let me catch a glimpse of paradise, only
to dash me into the abyss? When some unfortunate
wretch is doomed to death, do they take a barbarous
pleasure in placing before his eyes all that would make
him love life and regret leaving it? Such is, however,
my fate: I have no other refuge, no other hope, than
the tomb, for, in my dire misfortune, I can no longer
dream of winning your hand. When fate smiled on
me, all my hopes were that you should be mine; to-day,
a poor man, I should abhor myself if I dared still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1188">[Pg 1188]</span>
to think of such blessedness, and, now that I can no
longer make you happy, though dying of love for you,
I forbid you to love me—”</p>

<p>The Marquise smiled at these last words.</p>

<p>“Madame,” said the King, “this is an honorable
man. But what prevents him from marrying his
lady-love?”</p>

<p>“Permit me, sire, to continue.”</p>

<p>“—This overwhelming injustice from the best of
kings surprises me. You know that my father asked
for me a commission as cornet or ensign in the
Guards, and that on this appointment depended the
happiness of my life, since it would give me the right
to offer myself to you. The Duc de Biron proposed
my name; but the King rejected me in a manner the
memory of which is very bitter to me. If my father
has his own way of looking at things (admitting that
it is a wrong one) must I suffer for it? My devotion
to the King is as true, as unbounded, as my love for
you. How gladly would I give proof of both these
sentiments, could I but draw the sword! Assuredly
I feel deeply distressed at my request being refused;
but that I should be thus disgraced without good
reason is a thing opposed to the well-known kindness
of his Majesty.”</p>

<p>“Aha!” said the King, “I am becoming interested.”</p>

<p>“—If you knew how very dull we are! Ah! my
friend! This estate of Neauflette, this country-house
of Vauvert, these wooded glades!—I wander about
them all day long. I have forbidden a rake to be
used; the sacrilegious gardener came yesterday with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1189">[Pg 1189]</span>
his iron-shod besom. He was about to touch the sand.
But the trace of your steps, lighter than the wind, was
not effaced. The prints of your little feet and of your
red satin heels were still upon the path; they seemed
to walk before me, as I followed your beautiful image,
and that charming fantom took shape at times as
though it were treading in the fugitive prints. It was
there, while conversing with you by the flower-beds,
that it was granted me to know you, to appreciate you.
A brilliant education joined to the spirit of an angel,
the dignity of a queen with the grace of a nymph,
thoughts worthy of Leibnitz expressed in language so
simple, Plato’s bee on the lips of Diana, all this enfolded
me as in a veil of adoration. And, during those
delicious moments, the darling flowers were blooming
about us, I inhaled their breath while listening to you,
in their perfume your memory lived. They droop
their heads now; they present to me the semblance
of death!”</p>

<p>“This is all Rousseau and water,” said the King.
“Why do you read such stuff to me?”</p>

<p>“Because your Majesty commanded me to do so,
for the sake of Mademoiselle d’Annebault’s beautiful
eyes.”</p>

<p>“It is true, she has beautiful eyes.”</p>

<p>“—And when I return from these walks, I find
my father alone, in the great drawing-room, near the
lighted candle, leaning on his elbow, amid the faded
gildings which cover our moldy wainscot. It is with
pain that he sees me enter. My grief disturbs his.
Athénaïs! At the back of that drawing-room, near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1190">[Pg 1190]</span>
the window, is the harpsichord over which flitted
those sweet fingers that my lips have touched but once—once,
while yours opened softly to harmonies of
celestial music—opened with such dainty art that your
songs were but a smile. How happy are they—Rameau,
Lulli, Duni, and so many more! Yes, yes,
you love them—they are in your memory—their
breath has passed through your lips. I too seat myself
at that harpsichord, I strive to play one of those
airs that you love;—how cold, how monotonous they
seem to me! I leave them and listen to their dying
accents while the echo loses itself beneath that lugubrious
vault. My father turns to me and sees me distressed—what
can he do? Some boudoir gossip, some
report from the servants’ hall has closed upon us the
gates that lead into the world. He sees me young,
ardent, full of life, asking only to live in this world,
he is my father, and can do nothing for me.”</p>

<p>“One would think,” said the King, “that this fellow
was starting for the hunt, and that his falcon had been
killed on his wrist. Against whom is he inveighing,
may I ask?”</p>

<p>“—It is quite true,” continued the Marquise, reading
in a lower tone. “It is quite true that we are
near neighbors, and distant relatives, of the Abbé
Chauvelin....”</p>

<p>“That is what it is, is it?” said Louis XV, yawning.
“Another nephew of the <em>enquêtes et requêtes</em>.
My Parliament abuses my bounty; it really has too
large a family.”</p>

<p>“But if it is only a <em>distant</em> relative!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1191">[Pg 1191]</span></p>

<p>“Enough; all these people are good for nothing.
This Abbé Chauvelin is a Jansenist; not a bad sort
of fellow, in his way; but he has dared to resign.
Please throw the letter into the fire, and let me hear
no more about it.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>If these last words of the King were not exactly
a death-warrant, they were something like a refusal
of permission to live. What could a young man without
fortune do, in 1756, whose King would not hear
his name mentioned? He might have looked for a
clerkship, or tried to turn philosopher, or poet, perhaps;
but without official dedication, the trade was
worth nothing.</p>

<p>And besides, such was not, by any means, the vocation
of the Chevalier Vauvert, who had written, with
tears, the letter which made the King laugh. At this
very moment, alone with his father, in the old château
of Neauflette, his look was desperate and gloomy, even
to frenzy, as he paced to and fro.</p>

<p>“I must go to Versailles,” he said.</p>

<p>“And what will you do there?”</p>

<p>“I know not; but what am I doing here?”</p>

<p>“You keep me company. It certainly can not be
very amusing for you, and I will not in any way seek
to detain you. But do you forget that your mother
is dead?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I promised her to consecrate to you the
life that you gave me. I will come back, but I must
go. I really can not stay in this place any longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1192">[Pg 1192]</span></p>

<p>“And why, if I may ask?”</p>

<p>“My desperate love is the only reason. I love
Mademoiselle d’Annebault madly.”</p>

<p>“But you know that it is useless. It is only
Molière who contrives successful matches without
dowries. Do you forget too the disfavor with which
I am regarded?”</p>

<p>“Ah! sir, that disfavor! Might I be allowed, without
deviating from the profound respect I owe you,
to ask what caused it? We do not belong to the Parliament.
We pay the tax; we do not order it. If the
Parliament stints the King’s purse, it is his affair, not
ours. Why should M. l’Abbé Chauvelin drag us into
his ruin?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur l’Abbé Chauvelin acts as an honest man.
He refuses to approve the ‘dixiéme’ tax because he is
disgusted at the prodigality of the court. Nothing
of this kind would have taken place in the days of
Madame de Chateauroux! She was beautiful, at
least, that woman, and did not cost us anything, not
even what she so generously gave. She was sovereign
mistress, and declared that she would be satisfied if
the King did not send her to rot in some dungeon
when he should be pleased to withdraw his good graces
from her. But this Étioles, this le Normand, this insatiable
Poisson!”</p>

<p>“What does it matter?”</p>

<p>“What does it matter! say you? More than you
think. Do you know that now, at this very time, while
the King is plundering us, the fortune of this grisette
is incalculable? She began by contriving to get an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1193">[Pg 1193]</span>
annuity of a hundred and eighty thousand livres—but
that was a mere bagatelle, it counts for nothing now;
you can form no idea of the startling sums that the
King showers upon her; three months of the year can
not pass without her picking up, as though by chance,
some five or six hundred thousand livres—yesterday
out of the salt-tax, to-day out of the increase in the
appropriation for the Royal mews. Although she has
her own quarters in the royal residences, she buys La
Selle, Cressy, Aulnay, Brimborion, Marigny, Saint-Remy,
Bellevue, and a number of other estates—mansions
in Paris, in Fontainebleau, Versailles, Compiègne—without
counting secret hoards in all the banks of
Europe, to be used in case of her own disgrace or a
demise of the crown. And who pays for all this, if
you please?”</p>

<p>“That I do not know, sir, but, certainly, not I.”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> you, as well as everybody else. It is France,
it is the people who toil and moil, who riot in the
streets, who insult the statue of Pigalle. But Parliament
will endure it no longer, it will have no more
new imposts. As long as there was question of defraying
the cost of the war, our last crown was ready;
we had no thought of bargaining. The victorious
King could see clearly that he was beloved by the
whole kingdom, still more so when he was at the point
of death. Then all dissensions, all faction, all ill-feeling
ceased. All France knelt before the sick-bed
of the King, and prayed for him. But if we pay, without
counting, for his soldiers and his doctors, we will
no longer pay for his mistresses; we have other things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1194">[Pg 1194]</span>
to do with our money than to support Madame de
Pompadour.”</p>

<p>“I do not defend her, sir. I could not pretend to
say either that she was in the wrong or in the right.
I have never seen her.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless; and you would not be sorry to see her—is
it not so?—in order to have an opinion on the
subject? For, at your age, the head judges through
the eyes. Try it then, if the fancy takes you. But the
satisfaction will be denied you.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir?”</p>

<p>“Because such an attempt is pure folly; because this
marquise is as invisible in her little boudoir at Brimborion
as the Grand Turk in his seraglio; because
every door will be shut in your face. What are you
going to do? Attempt an impossibility? Court fortune
like an adventurer?”</p>

<p>“By no means, but like a lover. I do not intend
to supplicate, sir, but to protest against an injustice.
I had a well-founded hope, almost a promise, from M.
de Biron; I was on the eve of possessing the object
of my love, and this love is not unreasonable; you
have not disapproved of it. Let me venture, then, to
plead my own cause. Whether I shall appeal to the
King or to Madame de Pompadour I know not, but
I wish to set out.”</p>

<p>“You do not know what the court is, and you wish
to present yourself there.”</p>

<p>“I may perhaps be the more easily received for the
very reason that I am unknown there.”</p>

<p>“You unknown, Chevalier! What are you thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1195">[Pg 1195]</span>
about? With such a name as yours! We are gentlemen
of an old stock, Monsieur; you could not be
unknown.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, the King will listen to me.”</p>

<p>“He will not even hear you. You see Versailles in
your dreams, and you will think yourself there when
your postilion stops his horses at the city gates. Suppose
you get as far as the ante-chamber—the gallery,
the Oeil de Bœuf; perhaps there may be nothing between
his Majesty and yourself but the thickness of
a door; there will still be an abyss for you to cross.
You will look about you, you will seek expedients,
protection, and you will find nothing. We are relatives
of M. de Chauvelin, and how do you think the
King takes vengeance on such as we? The rack for
Damiens, exile for the Parliament, but for us a word
is enough, or, worse still—silence. Do you know
what the silence of the King is, when, instead of replying
to you, he mutely stares at you, as he passes,
and annihilates you? After the Grève, and the Bastille,
this is a degree of torture which, though less
cruel in appearance, leaves its mark as plainly as the
hand of the executioner. The condemned man, it is
true, remains free, but he must no longer think of
approaching woman or courtier, drawing-room, abbey,
or barrack. As he moves about every door closes
upon him, every one who is anybody turns away, and
thus he walks this way and that, in an invisible
prison.”</p>

<p>“But I will so bestir myself in my prison that I
shall get out of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1196">[Pg 1196]</span></p>

<p>“No more than any one else! The son of M. de
Meynières was no more to blame than you. Like you,
he had received promises, he entertained most legitimate
hopes. His father, a devoted subject of his Majesty,
an upright man if there is one in the kingdom,
repulsed by his sovereign, bowed his gray head before
the <em>grisette</em>, not in prayer, but in ardent pleading. Do
you know what she replied? Here are her very words,
which M. de Meynières sends me in a letter: ‘The
King is the master, he does not deem it appropriate
to signify his displeasure to you personally; he is content
to make you aware of it by depriving your son
of a calling. To punish you otherwise would be to
begin an unpleasantness, and he wishes for none; we
must respect his will. I pity you, however; I realize
your troubles. I have been a mother; I know what
it must cost you to leave your son without a profession!’
This is how the creature expresses herself;
and you wish to put yourself at her feet!”</p>

<p>“They say they are charming, sir.”</p>

<p>“Of course they say so. She is not pretty, and the
King does not love her, as every one knows. He
yields, he bends before this woman. She <em>must</em> have
something else than that wooden head of hers to
maintain her strange power.”</p>

<p>“But they say she has so much wit.”</p>

<p>“And no heart!—Much to her credit, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“No heart! She who knows so well how to declaim
the lines of Voltaire, how to sing the music of
Rousseau! She who plays Alzire and Colette! No
heart! Oh, that can not be! I will never believe it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1197">[Pg 1197]</span></p>

<p>“Go then and see, since you wish it. I advise, I
do not command, but you will only be at the expense
of a useless journey.—You love this D’Annebault
young lady very much then?”</p>

<p>“More than my life.”</p>

<p>“<em>Alors</em>, be off!”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>It has been said that journeys injure love, because
they distract the mind; it has also been said that they
strengthen love, because they give one time to dream
over it. The chevalier was too young to make such
nice distinctions. Weary of the carriage, when half-way
on his journey, he had taken a saddle-hack and
thus arrived toward five o’clock in the evening at the
“Sun” Inn—a sign then out of fashion, since it dated
back to the time of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>There was, at Versailles, an old priest who had
been rector of a church near Neauflette; the chevalier
knew him and loved him. This curé, poor and simple
himself, had a nephew, who held a benefice, a court
abbé, who might therefore be useful. So the chevalier
went to this nephew who—man of importance as
he was—his chin ensconced in his “rabat,” received
the newcomer civilly, and condescended to listen to
his request.</p>

<p>“Come!” said he, “you arrive at a fortunate moment.
This is to be an opera-night at the court, some
sort of fête or other. I am not going, because I am
sulking so as to get something out of the marquise;
but here I happen to have a note from the Duc d’Aumont;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1198">[Pg 1198]</span>
I asked for it for some one else, but never mind,
you can have it. Go to the fête; you have not yet
been presented, it is true, but, for this entertainment,
that is not necessary. Try to be in the King’s way
when he goes into the little <em>foyer</em>. One look, and your
fortune is made.”</p>

<p>The chevalier thanked the abbé, and, worn out by
a disturbed night and a day on horseback, he made
his toilet at the inn in that negligent manner which
so well becomes a lover. A maid-servant, whose experience
had been decidedly limited, dressed his wig
as best she could, covering his spangled coat with
powder. Thus he turned his steps toward his luck
with the hopeful courage of twenty summers.</p>

<p>The night was falling when he arrived at the
château. He timidly advanced to the gate and asked
his way of a sentry. He was shown the grand staircase.
There he was informed by the tall Swiss that
the opera had just commenced, and that the King,
that is to say, everybody, was in the hall.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>“If Monsieur le Marquis will cross the court,”
added the doorkeeper (he conferred the title of “Marquis”
at a venture), “he will be at the play in an instant.
If he prefers to go through the apartments—”</p>

<p>The chevalier was not acquainted with the palace.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1199">[Pg 1199]</span></p>
<p>Curiosity prompted him, at first, to reply that he
would cross the apartments; then, as a lackey offered
to follow as a guide, an impulse of vanity made him
add that he needed no escort. He, therefore, went
forward alone, but not without a certain emotion of
timidity.</p>

<p>Versailles was resplendent with light. From the
ground-floor to the roof there glittered and blazed
lustres, chandeliers, gilded furniture, marbles. With
the exception of the Queen’s apartments, the doors
were everywhere thrown open. As the chevalier
walked on he was struck with an astonishment and
an admiration better imagined than described, for the
wonder of the spectacle that offered itself to his gaze
was not only the beauty, the sparkle of the display
itself, but the absolute solitude which surrounded him
in this enchanted wilderness.</p>

<p>To find one’s self alone in a vast enclosure, be it
temple, cloister, or castle, produces a strange, even a
weird feeling. The monument—whatever it be—seems
to weigh upon the solitary individual; its walls
gaze at him; its echoes are listening to him; the noise
of his steps breaks in upon a silence so deep that he
is impressed by an involuntary fear and dares not advance
without a feeling akin to awe. Such were the
chevalier’s first impressions, but curiosity soon got the
upper hand and drew him on. The candelabra of the
Gallery of Mirrors, looking into the polished surfaces,
saw their flames redoubled in them. Every one knows
what countless thousands of cherubs, nymphs, and
shepherdesses disport themselves on the panelings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1200">[Pg 1200]</span>
flutter about on the ceilings, and seem to encircle the
entire palace as with an immense garland. Here, vast
halls, with canopies of velvet shot with gold and chairs
of state still impressed with the stiff majesty of the
“great King”; there, creased and disordered ottomans,
chairs in confusion around a card-table; a never-ending
succession of empty salons, where all this magnificence
shone out the more that it seemed entirely
useless. At intervals were half-concealed doors opening
upon corridors that extended as far as the eye
could reach, a thousand staircases, a thousand passages
crossing each other as in a labyrinth; colonnades,
raised platforms built for giants, boudoirs ensconced
in corners like children’s hiding-places, an enormous
painting of Vanloo near a mantel of porphyry; a forgotten
patch-box, lying beside a piece of grotesque
Chinese workmanship; here a crushing grandeur,
there an effeminate grace; and everywhere, in the
midst of luxury, of prodigality, and of indolence, a
thousand intoxicating odors, strange and diverse,
mingle perfumes of flowers and women, an enervating
warmth, the very material and sensible atmosphere of
pleasure itself.</p>

<p>To be in such a place, amid such marvels, at twenty,
and to be there alone, is surely quite sufficient cause
for temporary intoxication. The chevalier advanced
at haphazard, as in a dream.</p>

<p>“A very palace of fairies,” he murmured, and, indeed,
he seemed to behold, unfolding itself before him,
one of those tales in which wandering knights discover
enchanted castles. Were they indeed mortal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1201">[Pg 1201]</span>
creatures that inhabited this matchless abode? Were
they real women who came and sat on these chairs and
whose graceful outlines had left on those cushions
that slight impress, so suggestive, even yet, of indolence?
Who knows but that, behind those thick curtains,
at the end of some long dazzling gallery, there
may perhaps soon appear a princess asleep for the last
hundred years, a fairy in hoops, an Armida in spangles,
or some court hamadryad that shall issue forth
from this marble column, or burst from out of that
gilded panel?</p>

<p>Bewildered, almost overpowered, at the sight of all
these novel objects, the young chevalier, in order the
better to indulge his reverie, had thrown himself on
a sofa, and would doubtless have forgotten himself
there for some time had he not remembered that he
was in love. What, at this hour, was Mademoiselle
d’Annebault, his beloved, doing—left behind in her
old château?</p>

<p>“Athénaïs!” he exclaimed suddenly, “why do I thus
waste my time here? Is my mind wandering? Great
heavens! Where am I? And what is going on
within me?”</p>

<p>He soon rose and continued his travels through
this <em>terra incognita</em>, and of course lost his way. Two
or three lackeys, speaking in a low voice, stood before
him at the end of a gallery. He walked toward them
and asked how he should find his way to the play.</p>

<p>“If M. le Marquis,” he was answered (the same
title being still benevolently granted him), “will give
himself the trouble to go down that staircase and follow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1202">[Pg 1202]</span>
the gallery on the right, he will find at the end of
it three steps going up; he will then turn to the left,
go through the Diana salon, that of Apollo, that of
the Muses, and that of Spring; he will go down six
steps more, then, leaving the Guards’ Hall on his
right and crossing over to the Ministers’ staircase, he
will not fail to meet there other ushers who will show
him the way.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” said the chevalier, “with such excellent
instruction, it will certainly be my fault if I
do not find my way.”</p>

<p>He set off again boldly, constantly stopping, however,
in spite of himself, to look from side to side,
then once more remembering his love. At last, at
the end of a full quarter of an hour, he once more
found, as he had been told, a group of lackeys.</p>

<p>“M. le Marquis is mistaken,” they informed him;
“it is through the other wing of the château that he
should have gone, but nothing is easier for him than
to retrace his steps. M. le Marquis has but to go
down this staircase, then he will cross the salon of
the Nymphs, that of Summer, that of—”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” said the chevalier, proceeding on his
way. “How foolish I am,” he thought, “to go on
asking people in this fashion like a rustic. I am making
myself ridiculous to no purpose, and even supposing—though
it is not likely—that they are not laughing
at me, of what use is their list of names, and the
pompous sobriquets of these salons, not one of which
I know?”</p>

<p>He made up his mind to go straight before him as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1203">[Pg 1203]</span>
far as possible. “For, after all,” said he to himself,
“this palace is very beautiful and prodigiously vast,
but it is not boundless, and, were it three times as
large as our rabbit enclosure, I must at last reach the
end of it.”</p>

<p>But it is not easy in Versailles to walk on for a
long time in one direction, and this rustic comparison
of the royal dwelling to a rabbit enclosure doubtless
displeased the nymphs of the place, for they at once
set about leading the poor lover astray more than
ever, and, doubtless, to punish him, took pleasure in
making him retrace his steps over and over again,
constantly bringing him back to the same place, like
a countryman lost in a thicket of quickset; thus did
they shut him in in this Cretan labyrinth of marble
and gold.</p>

<p>In the “Antiquities of Rome,” by Piranesi, there is
a series of engravings which the artist calls “his
dreams,” and which are supposed to reproduce his
own visions during a fit of delirious fever. These
engravings represent vast Gothic halls; on the flagstones
are strewn all sorts of engines and machines,
wheels, cables, pulleys, levers, catapults, the expression
of enormous power and formidable resistance.
Along the walls you perceive a staircase, and upon
this staircase, climbing, not without trouble, Piranesi
himself. Follow the steps a little higher and they
suddenly come to an end before an abyss. Whatever
has happened to poor Piranesi, you think that he has,
at any rate, reached the end of his labors, for he can
not take another step without falling; but lift your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1204">[Pg 1204]</span>
eyes and you will see a second staircase rising in the
air, and upon these stairs Piranesi again, again on the
brink of a precipice.</p>

<p>Look now still higher, and another staircase still
rises before you, and again poor Piranesi continuing
his ascent, and so on, until the everlasting staircase
and the everlasting Piranesi disappear together in the
skies; that is to say, in the border of the engraving.</p>

<p>This allegory, offspring of a nightmare, represents
with a high degree of accuracy the tedium of useless
labor and the species of vertigo which is brought on
by impatience. The chevalier, wandering incessantly
from salon to salon and from gallery to gallery, was
at last seized with a fit of downright exasperation.</p>

<p>“Parbleu,” said he, “but this is cruel! After having
been so charmed, so enraptured, so enthralled, to
find myself alone in this cursed palace.” (It was no
longer a palace of fairies!) “I shall never be able to
get out of it! A plague upon the infatuation which
inspired me with the idea of entering this place, like
Prince Fortunatus with his boots of solid gold, instead
of simply getting the first lackey I came across
to take me to the play at once!”</p>

<p>The chevalier experienced this tardy feeling of
repentance for his rashness at a moment when, like
Piranesi, he was half-way up a staircase, on a landing
between three doors. Behind the middle one, he
thought he heard a murmur so sweet, so light, so
voluptuous, that he could not help listening. At the
very instant when he was tremblingly advancing with
the indiscreet intention of eavesdropping, this door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1205">[Pg 1205]</span>
swung open. A breath of air, balmy with a thousand
perfumes, a torrent of light that rendered the very
mirrors of the gallery lustreless struck him so suddenly
that he perforce stepped back.</p>

<p>“Does Monsieur le Marquis wish to enter?” asked
the usher who had opened the door.</p>

<p>“I wish to go to the play,” replied the chevalier.</p>

<p>“It is just this moment over.”</p>

<p>At the same time, a bevy of beautiful ladies, their
complexions delicately tinted with white and carmine,
escorted by lords, old and young, who led them, not
by the arm, nor even by the hand, but by the tips of
their fingers, began filing out from the Palace Theatre,
taking great care to walk sidewise, in order not to
disarrange their hoops.</p>

<p>All of these brilliant people spoke in a low voice,
with an air half grave, half gay, a mixture of awe and
respect.</p>

<p>“What can this be?” said the Chevalier, not guessing
that chance had luckily brought him to the little
<em>foyer</em>.</p>

<p>“The King is about to pass,” replied the usher.</p>

<p>There is a kind of intrepidity, which hesitates at
nothing; it comes but too easily, it is the courage of
vulgar people. Our young provincial, although he
was reasonably brave, did not possess this faculty.
At the mere words, “The King is about to pass,” he
stood motionless and almost terror-stricken.</p>

<p>King Louis XV, who when out hunting would
ride on horseback a dozen leagues with ease, was, in
other respects, as is known, royally indolent. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1206">[Pg 1206]</span>
boasted, not without reason, that he was the first gentleman
of France, and his mistresses used to tell him,
not without truth, that he was the best built and the
most handsome. It was something to remember to
see him leave his chair, and deign to walk in person.
When he crossed the <em>foyer</em>, with one arm laid, or
rather stretched, on the shoulder of Monsieur d’Argenson,
while his red heel glided over the polished
floor (he had made his laziness the fashion), all whisperings
ceased; the courtiers lowered their heads, not
daring to bow outright, and the fine ladies, gently
bending their knees within the depths of their immense
furbelows, ventured that coquettish good-night
which our grandmothers called a courtesy, and which
our century has replaced by the brutal English shake
of the hand.</p>

<p>But the King paid attention to nothing, and saw
only what pleased him. Alfieri, perhaps, was there,
and it is he who thus describes, in his memoirs, his
presentation at Versailles:</p>

<p>“I well knew that the king never spoke to strangers
who were not of striking appearance; all the
same I could not brook the impassible and frowning
demeanor of Louis XV. He scanned from head to
foot the man who was being presented to him, and it
looked as if he received no impression by so doing.
It seems to me, however, that if one were to say to
a giant, ‘Here is an ant I present to you,’ he would
smile on looking at it, or perhaps say, ‘Oh! what a
little creature.’”</p>

<p>The taciturn monarch thus passed among these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1207">[Pg 1207]</span>
flowers of feminine loveliness, and all this court, alone
in spite of the crowd. It did not require of the chevalier
much reflection to understand that he had nothing
to hope from the King, and that the recital of his love
would obtain no success in that quarter.</p>

<p>“Unfortunate that I am!” thought he. “My father
was but too well informed when he told me that within
two steps of the king I should see an abyss between
him and me. Were I to venture to ask for an audience,
who would be my patron? Who would present
me? There he is—the absolute master, who can by
a word change my destiny, assure my fortune, fulfil
my desires. He is there before me; were I to stretch
out my hand I could touch his embroidered coat—and
I feel myself farther from him than if I were still
buried in the depths of my native province! Oh! If
I could only speak to him! Only approach him!
Who will come to my help?”</p>

<p>While the chevalier was in this unhappy state of
mind he saw entering with an air of the utmost grace
and delicacy a young and attractive woman, clad very
simply in a white gown, without diamonds or embroideries
and with a single rose in her hair. She
gave her hand to a lord <em>tout à l’ambre</em>, as Voltaire
expresses it, and spoke softly to him behind her fan.
Now chance willed it that, in chatting, laughing, and
gesticulating, this fan should slip from her and fall
beneath a chair, immediately in front of the chevalier.
He at once hurried to pick it up, and as in doing so
he had set one knee on the floor, the young lady appeared
to him so charming that he presented her the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1208">[Pg 1208]</span>
fan without rising. She stopped, smiled, and passed
on, thanking him with a slight movement of the head,
but at the look she had given the chevalier he felt his
heart beat without knowing why. He was right.
This young lady was <em>la petite d’Étioles</em>, as the malcontents
still called her, while others in speaking of
her said “la Marquise” in that reverent tone in which
one says “The Queen.”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>“She will protect me! She will come to my rescue!
Ah! how truly the abbé spoke when he said that one
look might decide my life. Yes, those eyes, so soft
and gentle, that little mouth, both merry and sweet,
that little foot almost hidden under the <em>pompon</em>—Yes,
here is my good fairy!”</p>

<p>Thus thought the chevalier, almost aloud, as he returned
to the inn. Whence came this sudden hope?
Did his youth alone speak, or had the eyes of the
marquise told a tale?</p>

<p>He passed the greater part of the night writing to
Mademoiselle d’Annebault such a letter as we heard
read by Madame de Pompadour to her lord.</p>

<p>To reproduce this letter would be a vain task. Excepting
idiots, lovers alone find no monotony in repeating
the same thing over and over again.</p>

<p>At daybreak the chevalier went out and began
roaming about, carrying his dreams through the
streets. It did not occur to him to have recourse once
more to the protecting abbé, and it would not be easy
to tell the reason which prevented his doing so. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1209">[Pg 1209]</span>
was like a blending of timidity and audacity, of false
shame and romantic honor. And, indeed, what would
the abbé have replied to him, if he had told his story
of the night before? “You had the unique good fortune
to pick up this fan; did you know how to profit
by it? What did the marquise say to you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“You should have spoken to her.”</p>

<p>“I was confused; I had lost my head.”</p>

<p>“That was wrong; one must know how to seize an
opportunity; but this can be repaired. Would you like
me to present you to Monsieur So-and-so, one of my
friends; or perhaps to Madame Such-a-one? That
would be still better. We will try and secure for you
access to this marquise who frightened you so, and
then”—and so forth.</p>

<p>Now the chevalier little relished anything of this
kind. It seemed to him that, in telling his adventure,
he would, so to speak, soil and mar it. He said to
himself that chance had done for him something unheard
of, incredible, and that it should remain a secret
between himself and Fortune. To confide this secret
to the first comer was, to his thinking, to rob it of its
value, and to show himself unworthy of it. “I went
alone yesterday to the castle at Versailles,” thought
he, “I can surely go alone to Trianon?” This was, at
the time, the abode of the favorite.</p>

<p>Such a way of thinking might, and even should,
appear extravagant to calculating minds, who neglect
no detail, and leave as little as possible to chance; but
colder mortals, if they were ever young, and not everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1210">[Pg 1210]</span>
is so, even in youth, have known that strange
sentiment, both weak and bold, dangerous and seductive,
which drags us to our fate. One feels one’s self
blind, and wishes to be so; one does not know where
one is going and yet walks on. The charm of the
thing consists in this recklessness and this very ignorance;
it is the pleasure of the artist in his dreams, of
the lover spending the night beneath the windows of
his mistress; it is the instinct of the soldier; it is,
above all, that of the gamester.</p>

<p>The chevalier, almost without knowing it, had thus
taken his way to Trianon. Without being very <em>paré</em>,
as they said in those days, he lacked neither elegance
nor that indescribable air which forbids a chance
lackey, meeting one, from daring to ask where one is
going. It was, therefore, not difficult for him, thanks
to information he had obtained at the inn, to reach the
gate of the château—if one can so call that marble
<em>bonbonnière</em>, which has seen so many pleasures and
pains in bygone days. Unfortunately, the gate was
closed, and a stout Swiss wearing a plain coat was
walking about, his hands behind his back, in the inner
avenue, like a person who is not expecting any one.</p>

<p>“The King is here!” said the chevalier to himself,
“or else the marquise is away. Evidently, when the
doors are closed, and valets stroll about, the masters
are either shut in or gone out.”</p>

<p>What was to be done? Full as he had been, a
moment earlier, of courage and confidence, he now
felt, all at once, confused and disappointed. The mere
thought, “The King is here!” alone gave him more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1211">[Pg 1211]</span>
alarm than those few words, on the night before:
“The King is about to pass!” For then he was but
facing the unknown, and now he knew that icy stare,
that implacable, impassible majesty.</p>

<p>“Ah! Bon Dieu! What a figure I should cut if
I were to be so mad as to try and penetrate this
garden, and find myself face to face with this superb
monarch, sipping his coffee beside a rivulet.”</p>

<p>At once the sinister shadow of the Bastille seemed
to fall before the poor lover; instead of the charming
image that he had retained of the marquise and her
smile, he saw dungeons, cells, black bread, questionable
water; he knew the story of Latude, thirty years
an inmate of the Bastille. Little by little his hope
seemed to be taking to itself wings.</p>

<p>“And yet,” he again said to himself, “I am doing
no harm, nor the King either. I protest against an
injustice; but I never wrote or sang scurrilous songs.
I was so well received at Versailles yesterday, and the
lackeys were so polite! What am I afraid of? Of
committing a blunder? I shall make many more
which will repair this one.”</p>

<p>He approached the gate and touched it with his
finger. It was not quite closed. He opened it, and
resolutely entered.</p>

<p>The gatekeeper turned round with a look of annoyance.</p>

<p>“What are you looking for? Where are you
going?”</p>

<p>“I am going to Madame de Pompadour.”</p>

<p>“Have you an audience?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1212">[Pg 1212]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where is your letter?”</p>

<p>He was no longer the “marquis” of the night before,
and, this time, there was no Duc d’Aumont.
The chevalier lowered his eyes sadly, and noticed that
his white stockings and Rhinestone buckles were covered
with dust. He had made the mistake of coming
on foot, in a region where no one walked. The gatekeeper
also bent his eyes, and scanned him, not from
head to foot, but from foot to head. The dress
seemed neat enough, but the hat was rather askew,
and the hair lacked powder.</p>

<p>“You have no letter. What do you wish?”</p>

<p>“I wish to speak to Madame de Pompadour.”</p>

<p>“Really! And you think this is the way it is
done?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about it. Is the King here?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Go about your business and leave me
alone.”</p>

<p>The chevalier did not wish to lose his temper, but,
in spite of himself, this insolence made him turn pale.</p>

<p>“I sometimes have told a lackey to go away,” he
replied, “but a lackey never said so to me.”</p>

<p>“Lackey! I a lackey?” exclaimed the enraged gatekeeper.</p>

<p>“Lackey, doorkeeper, valet, or menial, I care not,
and it matters little.”</p>

<p>The gatekeeper made a step toward the chevalier
with clenched fists and face aflame. The chevalier,
brought to himself by the appearance of a threat, lifted
the handle of his sword slightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1213">[Pg 1213]</span></p>

<p>“Take care, fellow,” said he, “I am a gentleman,
and it would cost me but thirty-six livres to put a boor
like you under ground.”</p>

<p>“If you are a nobleman, monsieur, I belong to the
King; I am only doing my duty; so do not think—”</p>

<p>At this moment the flourish of a hunting-horn
sounding from the Bois de Satory was heard afar,
and lost itself in the echo. The chevalier allowed his
sword to drop into its scabbard, no longer thinking
of the interrupted quarrel.</p>

<p>“I declare,” said he, “it is the King starting for the
hunt! Why did you not tell me that before?”</p>

<p>“That has nothing to do with me, nor with you
either.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, my good man. The King is not
here; I have no letter, I have no audience. Here is
some money for you; let me in.”</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket several pieces of gold.
The gatekeeper scanned him anew with a superb
contempt.</p>

<p>“What is that?” said he, disdainfully. “Is it thus
you seek to penetrate into a royal dwelling? Instead
of making you go out, take care I don’t lock you in.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em>—you valet!” said the chevalier, getting angry
again and once more seizing his sword.</p>

<p>“Yes, I,” repeated the big man. But during this
conversation, in which the historian regrets to have
compromised his hero, thick clouds had darkened the
sky; a storm was brewing. A flash of lightning
burst forth, followed by a violent peal of thunder, and
the rain began to fall heavily. The chevalier, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1214">[Pg 1214]</span>
still held his gold, saw a drop of water on his dusty
shoe as large as a crown piece.</p>

<p>“Peste!” said he, “let us find shelter. It would
never do to get wet.”</p>

<p>He turned nimbly toward the den of Cerberus, or,
if you please, the gatekeeper’s lodge. Once in there,
he threw himself unceremoniously into the big armchair
of the gatekeeper himself.</p>

<p>“Heavens! How you annoy me!” said he, “and
how unfortunate I am! You take me for a conspirator,
and you do not understand that I have in my
pocket a petition for his Majesty! If I am from the
country, you are nothing but a dolt.”</p>

<p>The gatekeeper, for answer, went to a corner to
fetch his halberd, and remained standing thus with
the weapon in his fist.</p>

<p>“When are you going away?” he cried out in a
stentorian voice.</p>

<p>The quarrel, in turn forgotten and taken up again,
seemed this time to be becoming quite serious, and
already the gatekeeper’s two big hands trembled
strangely on his pike;—what was to happen? I do
not know. But, suddenly turning his head—“Ah!”
said the chevalier, “who comes here?”</p>

<p>A young page mounted on a splendid horse (not an
English one;—at that time thin legs were not the
fashion) came up at full speed. The road was
soaked with rain; the gate was but half open. There
was a pause; the keeper advanced and opened the
gate. The page spurred his horse, which had stopped
for the space of an instant; it tried to resume its gait,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1215">[Pg 1215]</span>
but missed its footing, and, slipping on the damp
ground, fell.</p>

<p>It is very awkward, almost dangerous, to raise a
fallen horse. A riding-whip is of no use. The kicking
of the beast, which is doing its best, is extremely
disagreeable, especially when one’s own leg is caught
under the saddle.</p>

<p>The chevalier, however, came to the rescue without
thinking of these inconveniences, and set about it so
cleverly that the horse was soon raised and the rider
freed. But the latter was covered with mud and
could scarcely limp along.</p>

<p>Carried as well as might be to the gatekeeper’s
lodge and seated in his turn in the big armchair,
“Sir,” said he to the chevalier, “you are certainly a
nobleman. You have rendered me a great service, but
you can render me a still greater one. Here is a message
from the King for Madame la Marquise, and
this message is very urgent, as you see, since my horse
and I, in order to go faster, almost broke our necks.
You understand that, wounded as I am, with a lame
leg, I could not deliver this paper. I should have, in
order to do so, to be carried myself. Will you go
there in my stead?”</p>

<p>At the same time he drew from his pocket a large
envelope ornamented with gilt arabesques and fastened
with the royal seal.</p>

<p>“Very willingly, sir,” replied the chevalier, taking
the envelope.</p>

<p>And, nimble and light as a feather, he set out at
a run and on the tips of his toes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1216">[Pg 1216]</span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>When the chevalier arrived at the château he found
another doorkeeper in front of the peristyle:</p>

<p>“By the King’s order,” said the young man, who
this time no longer feared halberds, and, showing his
letter, he passed gaily between half a dozen lackeys.</p>

<p>A tall usher, planted in the middle of the vestibule,
seeing the order and the royal seal, gravely inclined
himself, like a poplar bent by the wind—then, smiling,
he touched with one of his bony fingers the corner
of a piece of paneling.</p>

<p>A little swinging door, masked by tapestry, at once
opened as if of its own accord. The bony man made
an obsequious sign, the chevalier entered, and the
tapestry, which had been drawn apart, fell softly
behind him.</p>

<p>A silent valet introduced him into a drawing-room,
then into a corridor, in which there were two or three
closed doors, then at last into a second drawing-room,
and begged him to wait a moment.</p>

<p>“Am I here again in the château of Versailles?” the
chevalier asked himself. “Are we going to begin another
game of hide-and-seek?”</p>

<p>Trianon was, at that time, neither what it is now
nor what it had been. It has been said that Madame
de Maintenon had made of Versailles an oratory, and
Madame de Pompadour a boudoir. It has also been
said of Trianon that <em>ce petit château de porcelaine</em> was
the boudoir of Madame de Montespan. Be that as it
may, concerning these boudoirs, it appears that Louis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1217">[Pg 1217]</span>
XV put them everywhere. This or that gallery, which
his ancestor walked majestically, was then divided
oddly into an infinity of apartments. There were
some of every color, and the King went fluttering
about in all these gardens of silk and velvet.</p>

<p>“Do you think my little furnished apartments are
in good taste?” he one day asked the beautiful Comtesse
de Sérrant.</p>

<p>“No,” said she, “I would have them in blue.”</p>

<p>As blue was the King’s color, this answer flattered
him.</p>

<p>At their next meeting, Madame de Sérrant found
the salon upholstered in blue, as she had wished it.</p>

<p>That in which the chevalier now found himself
alone was neither blue nor pink, it was all mirrors.
We know how much a pretty woman with a lovely
figure gains by letting her image repeat itself in a
thousand aspects. She bewilders, she envelops, so to
speak, him whom she desires to please. To whatever
side he turns, he sees her. How can he avoid being
charmed? He must either take to flight or own himself
conquered.</p>

<p>The chevalier looked at the garden, too. There,
behind, the bushes and labyrinths, the statues and the
marble vases, that pastoral style which the marquise
was about to introduce, and which, later on, Madame
Du Barry and Marie Antoinette were to push to such
a high degree of perfection, was beginning to show
itself. Already there appeared the rural fantasies
where the <em>blasé</em> conceits were disappearing. Already
the puffing tritons, the grave goddesses, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1218">[Pg 1218]</span>
learned nymphs, the busts with flowing wigs, frozen
with horror in their wealth of verdure, beheld an English
garden rise from the ground, amid the wondering
trees. Little lawns, little streams, little bridges,
were soon to dethrone Olympus to replace it by a dairy,
strange parody of nature, which the English copy
without understanding—very child’s play, for the
nonce the pastime of an indolent master who tried in
vain to escape the ennui of Versailles while remaining
at Versailles itself.</p>

<p>But the chevalier was too charmed, too enraptured
at finding himself there for a critical thought to present
itself to his mind. He was, on the contrary,
ready to admire everything, and was indeed admiring,
twirling his missive between his fingers as a rustic
does his hat, when a pretty waiting-maid opened the
door, and said to him softly:</p>

<p>“Come, monsieur.”</p>

<p>He followed her, and after having once more passed
through several corridors which were more or less
mysterious, she ushered him into a large apartment
where the shutters were half-closed. Here she stopped
and seemed to listen.</p>

<p>“Still at hide-and-seek!” said the chevalier to himself.
However, at the end of a few moments, yet another
door opened, and another waiting-maid, who
seemed to be even prettier than the first, repeated to
him in the same tone the same words:</p>

<p>“Come, monsieur.”</p>

<p>If he had been the victim of one kind of emotion
at Versailles, he was subject to another, and still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1219">[Pg 1219]</span>
deeper feeling now, for he stood on the threshold of
the temple in which the divinity dwelt. He advanced
with a palpitating heart. A soft light, slightly veiled
by thin, gauze curtains, succeeded obscurity; a delicious
perfume, almost imperceptible, pervaded the air
around him; the waiting-maid timidly drew back the
corner of a silk portière, and, at the end of a large
chamber furnished with elegant simplicity, he beheld
the lady of the fan—the all-powerful marquise.</p>

<p>She was alone, seated before a table, wrapped in a
dressing-gown, her head resting on her hand, and,
seemingly, deeply preoccupied. On seeing the chevalier
enter, she rose with a sudden and apparently
involuntary movement.</p>

<p>“You come on behalf of the King?”</p>

<p>The chevalier might have answered, but he could
think of nothing better than to bow profoundly while
presenting to the marquise the letter which he brought
her. She took it, or rather seized upon it, with extreme
eagerness. Her hands trembled on the envelope
as she broke the seal.</p>

<p>This letter, written by the King’s hand, was rather
long. She devoured it at first, so to speak, with a
glance, then she read it greedily, with profound attention,
with wrinkled brow and tightened lips. She was
not beautiful thus, and no longer resembled the magic
apparition of the <em>petit foyer</em>. When she reached the
end, she seemed to reflect. Little by little her face,
which had turned pale, assumed a faint color (at this
hour she did not wear rouge), and not only did she
regain that graceful air which habitually belonged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1220">[Pg 1220]</span>
her, but a gleam of real beauty illumined her delicate
features; one might have taken her cheeks for two
rose-leaves. She heaved a little sigh, allowed the letter
to fall upon the table, and, turning toward the
chevalier, said, with the most charming smile:</p>

<p>“I kept you waiting, monsieur, but I was not yet
dressed, and, indeed, am hardly so even now. That
is why I was forced to get you to come through the
private rooms, for I am almost as much besieged here
as though I were at home. I would like to answer the
King’s note. Would it be too much trouble to you to
do an errand for me?”</p>

<p>This time he <em>must</em> speak; the chevalier had had time
to regain a little courage:</p>

<p>“Alas! madame,” said he, sadly, “you confer a great
favor on me, but, unfortunately, I can not profit by it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I have not the honor to belong to his Majesty.”</p>

<p>“How, then, did you come here?”</p>

<p>“By chance; I met on my way a page who had been
thrown and who begged me—”</p>

<p>“How ‘thrown’?” repeated the marquise, bursting
out laughing. She seemed so happy at this moment
that gaiety came to her without an effort.</p>

<p>“Yes, madame, he fell from his horse at the gate.
I luckily found myself there to help him to rise, and,
as his dress was very much disordered, he begged me
to take charge of his message.”</p>

<p>“And by what chance did you find yourself there?”</p>

<p>“Madame, it was because I had a petition to present
to his Majesty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1221">[Pg 1221]</span></p>

<p>“His Majesty lives at Versailles.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you live here.”</p>

<p>“Oh! So it is you who wished to entrust me with
a message.”</p>

<p>“Madame, I beg you to believe—”</p>

<p>“Do not trouble yourself, you are not the first.
But why do you address yourself to me? I am but
a woman—like any other.”</p>

<p>As she uttered these words with a somewhat ironical
air, the marquise threw a triumphant look upon
the letter she had just read.</p>

<p>“Madame,” continued the chevalier, “I have always
heard that men exercise power, and that women—”</p>

<p>“Guide it, eh? Well, monsieur, there is a queen
of France.”</p>

<p>“I know it, madame; that is how it happened that
I found myself <em>here</em> this morning.”</p>

<p>The marquise was more than accustomed to such
compliments, though they were generally made in a
whisper; but, in the present circumstances, this appeared
to be quite singularly gratifying to her.</p>

<p>“And on what faith,” said she, “on what assurance,
did you believe yourself able to penetrate as far as
this? For you did not count, I suppose, upon a horse’s
falling on the way.”</p>

<p>“Madame, I believed—I hoped—”</p>

<p>“What did you hope?”</p>

<p>“I hoped that chance—might make—”</p>

<p>“Chance again! Chance is apparently one of your
friends; but I warn you that if you have no other, it
is a sad recommendation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1222">[Pg 1222]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps offended Chance wished to avenge herself
for this irreverence, for the chevalier, whom these
few questions had more and more troubled, suddenly
perceived, on the corner of the table, the identical
fan that he had picked up the night before. He took
it, and, as on the night before, presented it to the
marquise, bending the knee before her.</p>

<p>“Here, madame,” he said to her, “is the only friend
that could plead for me—”</p>

<p>The marquise seemed at first astonished, and hesitated
a moment, looking now at the fan, now at the
chevalier.</p>

<p>“Ah! you are right,” she said at last, “it is you,
monsieur! I recognize you. It is you whom I saw
yesterday, after the play, as I went by with M. de
Richelieu. I let my fan drop, and you ‘found yourself
there,’ as you were saying.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame.”</p>

<p>“And very gallantly, as a true chevalier, you returned
it to me. I did not thank you, but I was sure,
all the same, that he who knows how to pick up a fan
with such grace would also know, at the right time,
how to pick up the glove. And we are not ill-pleased
at that, we women.”</p>

<p>“And it is but too true, madame; for, on reaching
here just now, I almost had a duel with the gatekeeper.”</p>

<p>“Mercy on us!” said the marquise, once more seized
with a fit of gaiety. “With the gatekeeper! And
what about?”</p>

<p>“He would not let me come in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1223">[Pg 1223]</span></p>

<p>“That would have been a pity! But who are you,
monsieur? And what is your request?”</p>

<p>“Madame, I am called the Chevalier de Vauvert.
M. de Biron had asked in my behalf for a cornetcy in
the Guards.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I remember now. You come from Neauflette;
you are in love with Mademoiselle d’Annebault—”</p>

<p>“Madame, who could have told you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I warn you that I am much to be feared.
When memory fails me, I guess. You are a relative
of the Abbé de Chauvelin, and were refused on that
account; is not that so? Where is your petition?”</p>

<p>“Here it is, madame; but indeed I can not understand—”</p>

<p>“Why need you understand? Rise and lay your
paper on the table. I am going to answer the King’s
letter; you will take him, at the same time, your request
and my letter.”</p>

<p>“But, madame, I thought I had mentioned to
you—”</p>

<p>“You will go. You entered here on the business of
the King, is not that true? Well, then, you will enter
there in the business of the Marquise de Pompadour,
lady of the palace to the Queen.”</p>

<p>The chevalier bowed without a word, seized with
a sort of stupefaction. The world had long known
how much talk, how many ruses and intrigues, the
favorite had brought to bear, and what obstinacy she
had shown to obtain this title, which in reality brought
her nothing but a cruel affront from the Dauphin.
She had longed for it for ten years; she willed it, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1224">[Pg 1224]</span>
she had succeeded. So M. de Vauvert, whom she did
not know, although she knew of his love, pleased her
as a bearer of happy news.</p>

<p>Immovable, standing behind her, the chevalier
watched the marquise as she wrote, first, with all her
heart—with passion—then with reflection, stopping,
passing her hand under her little nose, delicate as
amber. She grew impatient: the presence of a witness
disturbed her. At last she made up her mind and
drew her pen through something; it must be owned
that after all it was but a rough draft.</p>

<p>Opposite the chevalier, on the other side of the
table, there glittered a fine Venetian mirror. This
timid messenger hardly dared raise his eyes. It
would, however, have been difficult not to see in this
mirror, over the head of the marquise, the anxious
and charming face of the new lady of the palace.</p>

<p>“How pretty she is!” thought he; “it is a pity that
I am in love with somebody else; but Athénaïs is more
beautiful, and moreover it would be on my part such
a horrible disloyalty.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” said the marquise.
The chevalier, as was his wont, had thought aloud
without knowing it. “What are you saying?”</p>

<p>“I, madame? I am waiting.”</p>

<p>“There; that is done,” the marquise went on, taking
another sheet of paper; but at the slight movement
she had made in turning around the dressing-gown
had slipped on her shoulder.</p>

<p>Fashion is a strange thing. Our grandmothers
thought nothing of going to court in immense robes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1225">[Pg 1225]</span>
exposing almost the entire bosom, and it was by no
means considered indecent; but they carefully hid the
back of their necks, which the fine ladies of to-day
expose so freely in the balcony of the opera. This is
a newly invented beauty.</p>

<p>On the frail, white, dainty shoulder of Madame de
Pompadour there was a little black mark that looked
like a fly floating in milk. The chevalier, serious as
a giddy boy who is trying to keep his countenance,
looked at the mark, and the marquise, holding her
pen in the air, looked at the chevalier in the
mirror.</p>

<p>In that mirror a rapid glance was exchanged, which
meant to say on the one side, “You are charming,”
and on the other, “I am not sorry for it.”</p>

<p>However, the marquise readjusted her dressing-gown.</p>

<p>“You are looking at my beauty-spot?”</p>

<p>“I am not looking, madame; I see and I admire.”</p>

<p>“Here is my letter; take it to the King with your
petition.”</p>

<p>“But, madame—”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“His Majesty is hunting; I have just heard the
horn in the wood of Satory.”</p>

<p>“That is true. I did not think of it. Well, to-morrow.
The day after; it matters little. No, immediately.
Go. You will give that to Lebel. Good-by,
monsieur. Try and remember the beauty-spot you
have just seen; the King alone in the whole kingdom
has seen it; and as for your friend, Chance, tell her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1226">[Pg 1226]</span>
I beg of you, to take care and not chatter to herself
so loud, as she did just now. Farewell, chevalier.”</p>

<p>She touched a little bell, then, lifting a flood of
laces upon her sleeve, held out to the young man her
bare arm. He once more bent low, and with the tips
of his lips scarcely brushed the rosy nails of the marquise.
She saw no impoliteness in it—far from it—but,
perhaps, a little too much modesty.</p>

<p>At once the little waiting-maids reappeared (the
big ones were not yet up), and, standing behind them,
like a steeple in the middle of a flock of sheep, the
bony man, still smiling, was pointing the way.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Alone, ensconced in an old armchair in the back
of his little room at the sign of “the Sun,” the chevalier
waited the next day, then the next, and no news!</p>

<p>“Singular woman! Gentle and imperious, good
and bad, the most frivolous of women, and the most
obstinate! She has forgotten me. What misery!
She is right;—she is all-powerful, and I am nothing.”</p>

<p>He had risen, and was walking about the room.</p>

<p>“Nothing!—no, I am but a poor devil. How truly
my father spoke! The marquise was mocking me;
that is all; while I was looking at her, it was only
the reflection in that mirror, and in my eyes, of her
own charms—which are, certainly, incomparable—that
made her look so pleased! Yes, her eyes are
small, but what grace! And Latour, before Diderot,
has taken the dust from a butterfly’s wing to paint
her portrait. She is not very tall, but her figure is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1227">[Pg 1227]</span>
perfectly exquisite. Ah! Mademoiselle d’Annebault!
Ah! my beloved friend, is it possible that I, too,
should forget?”</p>

<p>Two or three sharp raps at the door awoke him
from his grief.</p>

<p>“Who is there?”</p>

<p>The bony man, clad all in black, with a splendid
pair of silk stockings, which simulated calves that
were lacking, entered, and made a deep bow.</p>

<p>“This evening, Monsieur le Chevalier, there is to
be a masked ball at the court, and Madame la Marquise
sends me to say that you are invited.”</p>

<p>“That is enough, monsieur. Many thanks.”</p>

<p>As soon as the bony man had retired, the chevalier
ran to the bell; the same maid-servant who, three
days before, had done her best to be of service to him,
assisted him to put on the same spangled coat, striving
to acquit herself even better than before.</p>

<p>And then the young man took his way toward the
palace, invited this time, and more quiet outwardly,
but more anxious and less bold than when he had
made his first steps in that, to him, still unknown
world.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Bewildered, almost as much as on the former occasion,
by all the splendors of Versailles, which this
evening was not empty, the chevalier walked in the
great gallery, looking on every side and doing all he
could to learn why he was there; but nobody seemed
to think of accosting him. At the end of an hour he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1228">[Pg 1228]</span>
became wearied and was about to leave, when two
masks, exactly alike, seated on a bench, stopped him
on his way. One of them took aim at him with her
finger as if with a pistol; the other rose and went to
him:</p>

<p>“It appears, monsieur,” said the mask, carelessly
taking his arm, “that you are on very good terms with
our marquise.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, madame, but of whom are you
speaking?”</p>

<p>“You know well enough.”</p>

<p>“Not the least in the world.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but indeed you do.”</p>

<p>“Not at all.”</p>

<p>“All the court knows it.”</p>

<p>“I do not belong to the court.”</p>

<p>“You are playing the child. I tell you it is well
known!”</p>

<p>“That may be, madame, but I am ignorant of it.”</p>

<p>“You are not ignorant, however, of the fact that
the day before yesterday a page fell from his horse
at the gate of Trianon. Were you not there by
chance?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame.”</p>

<p>“Did you not help him to rise?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame.”</p>

<p>“And did not you enter the château?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“And was not a paper given to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame.”</p>

<p>“And did you not take it to the King?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1229">[Pg 1229]</span></p>

<p>“Assuredly.”</p>

<p>“The King was not at Trianon; he was hunting;
the marquise was alone—is not that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame.”</p>

<p>“She had just risen; she was scarcely clad, excepting,
as it is rumored, in a wide dressing-gown.”</p>

<p>“People whom one can not prevent from speaking
tell all that runs through their heads.”</p>

<p>“That is all well enough, but it appears that there
passed between your eyes and hers a look which did
not offend her.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, madame?”</p>

<p>“That you did not displease her.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about that, and I should be distressed
that such sweet and rare good-will, which
I did not expect, and which touched me to the bottom
of my heart, should give occasion to any idle
speeches.”</p>

<p>“You take fire too quickly, chevalier; one would
think that you were challenging the whole court; you
would never succeed in killing so many people.”</p>

<p>“But, madame, if the page fell, and if I carried his
message—allow me to ask you why I am interrogated.”</p>

<p>The mask pressed his arm and said to him:</p>

<p>“Listen, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“As much as you please, madame.”</p>

<p>“This is what we are thinking about now: The
King no longer loves the marquise, and nobody believes
that he ever loved her. She has just committed
an imprudence; she has set the whole Parliament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1230">[Pg 1230]</span>
against her with her ‘two sous’ tax, and to-day she
dares attack a far greater power—the Society of
Jesuits. She will fail, but she has weapons, and,
before perishing, she will defend herself.”</p>

<p>“Well, madame, what can I do?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you. M. de Choiseul has half quarreled
with M. de Bernis; neither of them is sure what it is
he would like to attempt. Bernis is going away;
Choiseul will take his place. A word from you can
decide it.”</p>

<p>“In what way, madame, pray?”</p>

<p>“By allowing your story of the other day to be
told.”</p>

<p>“What earthly connection can there be between my
visit, the Jesuits, and the Parliament?”</p>

<p>“Write me one word and the marquise is lost.
And do not doubt that the warmest interest, the most
complete gratitude—”</p>

<p>“I humbly beg your pardon again, madame, but
what you are asking of me would be an act of
cowardice.”</p>

<p>“Is there any honor in politics?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing of all that. Madame de Pompadour
let her fan fall before me; I picked it up; I gave
it back to her; she thanked me; she permitted me
with that peculiar grace of hers to thank her in my
turn.”</p>

<p>“A truce to ceremonies: time flies; my name is the
Countess d’Estrades; you love Mademoiselle d’Annebault,
my niece; do not say no, it is useless. You
are seeking a cornetcy; you shall have it to-morrow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1231">[Pg 1231]</span>
and if you care for Athénaïs you will soon be my
nephew.”</p>

<p>“Ah! madame, what excess of goodness!”</p>

<p>“But you must speak.”</p>

<p>“No, madame.”</p>

<p>“I have been told that you love that little girl.”</p>

<p>“As much as it is possible to love; but if ever my
love is to declare itself in her presence my honor must
also be there.”</p>

<p>“You are very obstinate, chevalier! Is that your
final reply?”</p>

<p>“It is the last, as it was the first.”</p>

<p>“You refuse to enter the Guards? You refuse the
hand of my niece?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame, if that be the price.”</p>

<p>Madame d’Estrades cast upon the chevalier a piercing
look, full of curiosity; then seeing in his face no
sign of hesitation she slowly walked away, losing herself
in the crowd.</p>

<p>The chevalier, unable to make anything of this singular
adventure, went and sat down in a corner of the
gallery.</p>

<p>“What does that woman mean to do?” said he to
himself. “She must be a little mad. She wishes to
upset the state by means of a silly calumny, and she
proposes to me that in order to merit the hand of her
niece I should dishonor myself. But Athénaïs would
no longer care for me, or, if she lent herself to such
an intrigue, I would no longer care for her. What!
Strive to harm this good marquise, to defame her, to
blacken her character. Never! no, never!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1232">[Pg 1232]</span></p>

<p>Always intent upon his own thoughts, the chevalier
very probably would have risen and spoken aloud, but
just then a small rosy finger touched him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>He raised his eyes and saw before him the pair of
masks who had stopped him.</p>

<p>“You do not wish to help us a little then?” said one
of the masks, disguising her voice. But although the
two costumes were exactly alike, and all seemed calculated
to mislead, the chevalier was not deceived.
Neither the look nor the tone was the same.</p>

<p>“Will you answer, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, madame.”</p>

<p>“Will you write?”</p>

<p>“Neither will I write.”</p>

<p>“It is true that you are obstinate. Good-night, lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“What do you say, madame?”</p>

<p>“There is your commission and your marriage contract.”
And she threw the fan to him.</p>

<p>It was the one which the chevalier had already
twice picked up. The little cupids of Boucher sported
on the parchment of the gilded mother-of-pearl masterpiece.
There was no longer any doubt; it was the
fan of Madame de Pompadour.</p>

<p>“Heavens! Marquise, is it possible?”</p>

<p>“Very possible,” said she, raising the little piece of
black veil on her chin.</p>

<p>“I know, madame, how to answer—”</p>

<p>“It is not necessary. You are a loyal gentleman,
and we shall see each other again, for we are to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1233">[Pg 1233]</span>
in the same house. The King has placed you in the
‘cornette blanche.’ Remember that for a petitioner
there is no greater eloquence than to know how to be
silent if need be—”</p>

<p>“And forgive us,” added she, laughing as she
ran away, “if before bestowing upon you our niece’s
hand, we thought it expedient to find out your true
worth.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><em>Théophile Gautier, great colorist and globe-trotter,
was born at Tarbes, in 1811, and died
at Neuilly in 1872. He began life as a painter,
then turned to poetry, and finally adopted prose
for the expression of his ideas, writing some
three hundred volumes in all of poetry, romances,
parodies, critiques, histories, tales, etc.</em></p>

<p><em>After being presented to Victor Hugo, he
became an enthusiastic apostle of Romanticism.
He lived in an atmosphere of Oriental splendor
noticeable in “The Mummy’s Foot.” His
style is unusually rich and sensuous, with a
refined fancy finely chiseled. He has exerted
a considerable influence on the present generation
of writers.</em></p>

<p><em>Though Gautier has expressed few original
ideas and few opinions, and is discursive, he
is, as his friend Baudelaire said of him, “an
unimpeachable poet, a finished magician in
French letters.”</em></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE MUMMY’S FOOT</h2>
</div>

<p class="center big1">BY THÉOPHILE GAUTIER</p>


<p class="center p2b">Translated by Lafcadio Hearn.</p>




<p>I had entered, in an idle mood, the shop of one
of those curiosity-venders, who are called <em>marchands
de bric-à-brac</em> in that Parisian <em>argot</em>
which is so perfectly unintelligible elsewhere in
France.</p>

<p>You have doubtless glanced occasionally through
the windows of some of these shops, which have become
so numerous now that it is fashionable to buy
antiquated furniture, and that every petty stockbroker
thinks he must have his <em>chambre au moyen âge</em>.</p>

<p>There is one thing there which clings alike to the
shop of the dealer in old iron, the wareroom of the
tapestry-maker, the laboratory of the chemist, and the
studio of the painter—in all those gloomy dens where
a furtive daylight filters in through the window-shutters
the most manifestly ancient thing is dust;—the
cobwebs are more authentic than the guimpe laces; and
the old pear-tree furniture on exhibition is actually
younger than the mahogany which arrived but yesterday
from America.</p>

<p>The warehouse of my bric-à-brac dealer was a
veritable Capharnaum; all ages and all nations seemed
to have made their rendezvous there; an Etruscan
lamp of red clay stood upon a Boule cabinet, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1238">[Pg 1238]</span>ebony panels, brightly striped by lines of inlaid brass;
a duchess of the court of Louis XV nonchalantly extended
her fawn-like feet under a massive table of the
time of Louis XIII, with heavy spiral supports of oak,
and carven designs of Chimeras and foliage intermingled.</p>

<p>Upon the denticulated shelves of several sideboards
glittered immense Japanese dishes with red and blue
designs relieved by gilded hatching; side by side with
enameled works by Bernard Palissy, representing serpents,
frogs, and lizards in relief.</p>

<p>From disemboweled cabinets escaped cascades of
silver-lustrous Chinese silks and waves of tinsel,
which an oblique sunbeam shot through with luminous
beads; while portraits of every era, in frames
more or less tarnished, smiled through their yellow
varnish.</p>

<p>The striped breastplate of a damascened suit of
Milanese armor glittered in one corner; Loves and
Nymphs of porcelain; Chinese grotesques, vases of
<em>célandon</em> and crackle-ware; Saxon and old Sèvres
cups encumbered the shelves and nooks of the apartment.</p>

<p>The dealer followed me closely through the tortuous
way contrived between the piles of furniture;
warding off with his hand the hazardous sweep of
my coat-skirts; watching my elbows with the uneasy
attention of an antiquarian and a usurer.</p>

<p>It was a singular face, that of the merchant—an
immense skull, polished like a knee, and surrounded
by a thin aureole of white hair, which brought out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1239">[Pg 1239]</span>
the clear salmon tint of his complexion all the more
strikingly, lent him a false aspect of patriarchal <em>bonhomie</em>,
counteracted, however, by the scintillation of
two little yellow eyes which trembled in their orbits
like two louis-d’or upon quicksilver. The curve of his
nose presented an aquiline silhouette, which suggested
the Oriental or Jewish type. His hands—thin, slender,
full of nerves which projected like strings upon the
finger-board of a violin, and armed with claws like
those on the terminations of bats’ wings—shook with
senile trembling; but those convulsively agitated
hands became firmer than steel pincers or lobsters’
claws when they lifted any precious article—an onyx
cup, a Venetian glass, or a dish of Bohemian crystal.
This strange old man had an aspect so thoroughly
rabbinical and cabalistic that he would have been
burnt on the mere testimony of his face three centuries
ago.</p>

<p>“Will you not buy something from me to-day, sir?
Here is a Malay kreese with a blade undulating like
flame: look at those grooves contrived for the blood
to run along, those teeth set backward so as to tear
out the entrails in withdrawing the weapon—it is a
fine character of ferocious arm, and will look well in
your collection: this two-handed sword is very beautiful—it
is the work of Josepe de la Hera; and this
<em>colichemarde</em>, with its fenestrated guard—what a
superb specimen of handicraft!”</p>

<p>“No; I have quite enough weapons and instruments
of carnage;—I want a small figure, something which
will suit me as a paper-weight; for I can not endure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1240">[Pg 1240]</span>
those trumpery bronzes which the stationers sell, and
which may be found on everybody’s desk.”</p>

<p>The old gnome foraged among his ancient wares,
and finally arranged before me some antique bronzes—so-called,
at least; fragments of malachite; little
Hindu or Chinese idols—a kind of poussah-toys in
jade-stone, representing the incarnations of Brahma
or Vishnu, and wonderfully appropriate to the very
undivine office of holding papers and letters in place.</p>

<p>I was hesitating between a porcelain dragon, all
constellated with warts—its mouth formidable with
bristling tusks and ranges of teeth—and an abominable
little Mexican fetish, representing the god Vitziliputzli
<em>au naturel</em>; when I caught sight of a charming
foot, which I at first took for a fragment of some
antique Venus.</p>

<p>It had those beautiful ruddy and tawny tints that
lend to Florentine bronze that warm, living look so
much preferable to the gray-green aspect of common
bronzes, which might easily be mistaken for statues
in a state of putrefaction: satiny gleams played over
its rounded forms, doubtless polished by the amorous
kisses of twenty centuries; for it seemed a Corinthian
bronze, a work of the best era of art—perhaps
molded by Lysippus himself.</p>

<p>“That foot will be my choice,” I said to the merchant,
who regarded me with an ironical and saturnine
air, and held out the object desired that I might
examine it more fully.</p>

<p>I was surprised at its lightness; it was not a foot
of metal, but in sooth a foot of flesh—an embalmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1241">[Pg 1241]</span>
foot—a mummy’s foot: on examining it still more
closely the very grain of the skin, and the almost
imperceptible lines impressed upon it by the texture
of the bandages, became perceptible. The toes were
slender and delicate, and terminated by perfectly
formed nails, pure and transparent as agates; the
great toe, slightly separated from the rest, afforded
a happy contrast, in the antique style, to the position
of the other toes, and lent it an aerial lightness—the
grace of a bird’s foot;—the sole, scarcely streaked by
a few almost imperceptible cross lines, afforded evidence
that it had never touched the bare ground, and
had only come in contact with the finest matting of
Nile rushes, and the softest carpets of panther skin.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!—you want the foot of the Princess Hermonthis”—exclaimed
the merchant, with a strange
giggle, fixing his owlish eyes upon me—“ha, ha, ha!—for
a paper-weight!—an original idea!—artistic
idea! Old Pharaoh would certainly have been surprised
had some one told him that the foot of his
adored daughter would be used for a paper-weight
after he had had a mountain of granite hollowed out
as a receptacle for the triple coffin, painted and gilded—covered
with hieroglyphics and beautiful paintings
of the Judgment of Souls”—continued the queer
little merchant, half audibly, as though talking to
himself!</p>

<p>“How much will you charge me for this mummy
fragment?”</p>

<p>“Ah, the highest price I can get; for it is a superb
piece: if I had the match of it you could not have it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1242">[Pg 1242]</span>
for less than five hundred francs;—the daughter of a
Pharaoh! nothing is more rare.”</p>

<p>“Assuredly that is not a common article; but, still,
how much do you want? In the first place, let me
warn you that all my wealth consists of just five louis:
I can buy anything that costs five louis, but nothing
dearer;—you might search my vest pockets and most
secret drawers without even finding one poor five-franc
piece more.”</p>

<p>“Five louis for the foot of the Princess Hermonthis!
that is very little, very little indeed; ’tis an authentic
foot,” muttered the merchant, shaking his head, and
imparting a peculiar rotary motion to his eyes. “Well,
take it, and I will give you the bandages into the bargain,”
he added, wrapping the foot in an ancient
damask rag—“very fine! real damask!—Indian
damask which has never been redyed; it is strong,
and yet it is soft,” he mumbled, stroking the frayed
tissue with his fingers, through the trade-acquired
habit which moved him to praise even an object of
so little value that he himself deemed it only worth
the giving away.</p>

<p>He poured the gold coins into a sort of medieval
alms-purse hanging at his belt, repeating:</p>

<p>“The foot of the Princess Hermonthis, to be used
for a paper-weight!”</p>

<p>Then turning his phosphorescent eyes upon me, he
exclaimed in a voice strident as the crying of a cat
which has swallowed a fish-bone:</p>

<p>“Old Pharaoh will not be well pleased: he loved his
daughter—the dear man!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1243">[Pg 1243]</span></p>

<p>“You speak as if you were a contemporary of his:
you are old enough, goodness knows! but you do not
date back to the Pyramids of Egypt,” I answered,
laughingly, from the threshold.</p>

<p>I went home, delighted with my acquisition.</p>

<p>With the idea of putting it to profitable use as soon
as possible, I placed the foot of the divine Princess
Hermonthis upon a heap of papers scribbled over with
verses, in themselves an undecipherable mosaic work
of erasures; articles freshly begun; letters forgotten,
and posted in the table drawer instead of the letter-box—an
error to which absent-minded people are peculiarly
liable. The effect was charming, bizarre, and
romantic.</p>

<p>Well satisfied with this embellishment, I went out
with the gravity and pride becoming one who feels
that he has the ineffable advantage over all the
passers-by whom he elbows, of possessing a piece of
the Princess Hermonthis, daughter of Pharaoh.</p>

<p>I looked upon all who did not possess, like myself,
a paper-weight so authentically Egyptian, as very
ridiculous people; and it seemed to me that the
proper occupation of every sensible man should consist
in the mere fact of having a mummy’s foot upon
his desk.</p>

<p>Happily I met some friends, whose presence distracted
me in my infatuation with this new acquisition:
I went to dinner with them; for I could not
very well have dined with myself.</p>

<p>When I came back that evening, with my brain
slightly confused by a few glasses of wine, a vague<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1244">[Pg 1244]</span>
whiff of Oriental perfume delicately titillated my olfactory
nerves: the heat of the room had warmed the
natron, bitumen, and myrrh in which the <em>paraschistes</em>,
who cut open the bodies of the dead, had bathed the
corpse of the princess;—it was a perfume at once
sweet and penetrating—a perfume that four thousand
years had not been able to dissipate.</p>

<p>The Dream of Egypt was Eternity: her odors have
the solidity of granite, and endure as long.</p>

<p>I soon drank deeply from the black cup of sleep:
for a few hours all remained opaque to me; Oblivion
and Nothingness inundated me with their sombre
waves.</p>

<p>Yet light gradually dawned upon the darkness of
my mind: dreams commenced to touch me softly in
their silent flight.</p>

<p>The eyes of my soul were opened; and I beheld my
chamber as it actually was: I might have believed myself
awake, but for a vague consciousness which assured
me that I slept, and that something fantastic
was about to take place.</p>

<p>The odor of the myrrh had augmented in intensity:
and I felt a slight headache, which I very naturally
attributed to several glasses of champagne that we
had drunk to the unknown gods and our future
fortunes.</p>

<p>I peered through my room with a feeling of expectation
which I saw nothing to justify: every article of
furniture was in its proper place; the lamp, softly
shaded by its globe of ground crystal, burned upon
its bracket; the water-color sketches shone under their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1245">[Pg 1245]</span>
Bohemian glass; the curtains hung down languidly;
everything wore an aspect of tranquil slumber.</p>

<p>After a few moments, however, all this calm interior
appeared to become disturbed; the woodwork
cracked stealthily; the ash-covered log suddenly
emitted a jet of blue flame; and the disks of the
pateras seemed like great metallic eyes, watching, like
myself, for the things which were about to happen.</p>

<p>My eyes accidentally fell upon the desk where I had
placed the foot of the Princess Hermonthis.</p>

<p>Instead of remaining quiet—as behooved a foot
which had been embalmed for four thousand years—it
commenced to act in a nervous manner; contracted
itself, and leaped over the papers like a
startled frog;—one would have imagined that it had
suddenly been brought into contact with a galvanic
battery: I could distinctly hear the dry sound made
by its little heel, hard as the hoof of a gazel.</p>

<p>I became rather discontented with my acquisition,
inasmuch as I wished my paper-weights to be of a
sedentary disposition, and thought it very unnatural
that feet should walk about without legs; and I
commenced to experience a feeling closely akin
to fear.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw the folds of my bed-curtain stir;
and heard a bumping sound, like that caused by some
person hopping on one foot across the floor. I must
confess I became alternately hot and cold; that I felt
a strange wind chill my back; and that my suddenly-rising
hair caused my nightcap to execute a leap of
several yards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1246">[Pg 1246]</span></p>

<p>The bed-curtains opened, and I beheld the strangest
figure imaginable before me.</p>

<p>It was a young girl of a very deep coffee-brown
complexion, like the bayadere Amani, and possessing
the purest Egyptian type of perfect beauty; her eyes
were almond-shaped and oblique, with eyebrows so
black that they seemed blue; her nose was exquisitely
chiseled, almost Greek in its delicacy of outline; and
she might indeed have been taken for a Corinthian
statue of bronze, but for the prominence of her cheekbones
and the slightly African fulness of her lips,
which compelled one to recognize her as belonging
beyond all doubt to the hieroglyphic race which dwelt
upon the banks of the Nile.</p>

<p>Her arms, slender and spindle-shaped, like those of
very young girls, were encircled by a peculiar kind
of metal bands, and bracelets of glass beads; her hair
was all twisted into little cords; and she wore upon
her bosom a little idol figure of green paste, bearing
a whip with seven lashes, which proved it to be an
image of Isis: her brow was adorned with a shining
plate of gold; and a few traces of paint relieved the
coppery tint of her cheeks.</p>

<p>As for her costume, it was very odd indeed.</p>

<p>Fancy a <em>pagne</em> or skirt all formed of little strips of
material bedizened with red and black hieroglyphics,
stiffened with bitumen, and apparently belonging to
a freshly unbandaged mummy.</p>

<p>In one of those sudden flights of thought so common
in dreams I heard the hoarse falsetto of the
<em>bric-à-brac</em> dealer, repeating like a monotonous refrain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1247">[Pg 1247]</span>
the phrase he had uttered in his shop with so
enigmatical an intonation:</p>

<p>“Old Pharaoh will not be well pleased: he loved
his daughter, the dear man!”</p>

<p>One strange circumstance, which was not at all
calculated to restore my equanimity, was that the
apparition had but one foot; the other was broken
off at the ankle!</p>

<p>She approached the table where the foot was starting
and fidgeting about more than ever; and there
supported herself upon the edge of the desk. I saw
her eyes fill with pearly-gleaming tears.</p>

<p>Although she had not as yet spoken, I fully comprehended
the thoughts which agitated her: she
looked at her foot—for it was indeed her own—with
an exquisitely graceful expression of coquettish sadness;
but the foot leaped and ran hither and thither,
as though impelled on steel springs.</p>

<p>Twice or thrice she extended her hand to seize it,
but could not succeed.</p>

<p>Then commenced between the Princess Hermonthis
and her foot—which appeared to be endowed
with a special life of its own—a very fantastic dialogue
in a most ancient Coptic tongue, such as might
have been spoken thirty centuries ago in the syrinxes
of the land of Ser: luckily I understood Coptic perfectly
well that night.</p>

<p>The Princess Hermonthis cried, in a voice sweet
and vibrant as the tones of a crystal bell:</p>

<p>“Well, my dear little foot, you always flee from
me; yet I always took good care of you. I bathed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1248">[Pg 1248]</span>
you with perfumed water in a bowl of alabaster; I
smoothed your heel with pumice-stone mixed with
palm oil; your nails were cut with golden scissors
and polished with a hippopotamus tooth; I was careful
to select <em>tatbebs</em> for you, painted and embroidered
and turned up at the toes, which were the envy of all
the young girls in Egypt: you wore on your great toe
rings bearing the device of the sacred Scarabæus; and
you supported one of the lightest bodies that a lazy
foot could sustain.”</p>

<p>The foot replied in a pouting and chagrined tone:</p>

<p>“You know well that I do not belong to myself
any longer. I have been bought and paid for: the
old merchant knew what he was about: he bore you
a grudge for having refused to espouse him. This is
an ill turn which he has done you. The Arab who
violated your royal coffin in the subterranean pits of
the necropolis of Thebes was sent thither by him: he
desired to prevent you from being present at the reunion
of the shadowy nations in the cities below.
Have you five pieces of gold for my ransom?”</p>

<p>“Alas, no!—my jewels, my rings, my purses of
gold and silver, were all stolen from me,” answered
the Princess Hermonthis, with a sob.</p>

<p>“Princess,” I then exclaimed, “I never retained
anybody’s foot unjustly;—even though you have
not got the five louis which it cost me, I present it
to you gladly: I should feel unutterably wretched
to think that I were the cause of so amiable a person
as the Princess Hermonthis being lame.”</p>

<p>I delivered this discourse in a royally gallant, troubadour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1249">[Pg 1249]</span>
tone which must have astonished the beautiful
Egyptian girl.</p>

<p>She turned a look of deepest gratitude upon me;
and her eyes shone with bluish gleams of light.</p>

<p>She took her foot—which surrendered itself willingly
this time—like a woman about to put on her little
shoe; and adjusted it to her leg with much skill.</p>

<p>This operation over, she took a few steps about
the room, as though to assure herself that she was
really no longer lame.</p>

<p>“Ah, how pleased my father will be!—he who was
so unhappy because of my mutilation; and who from
the moment of my birth, set a whole nation at work
to hollow me out a tomb so deep that he might preserve
me intact until that last day, when souls must
be weighed in the balance of Amenthi! Come with
me to my father;—he will receive you kindly; for
you have given me back my foot.”</p>

<p>I thought this proposition natural enough. I arrayed
myself in a dressing-gown of large-flowered
pattern, which lent me a very Pharaonic aspect; hurriedly
put on a pair of Turkish slippers; and informed
the Princess Hermonthis that I was ready to follow
her.</p>

<p>Before starting, Hermonthis took from her neck
the little idol of green paste, and laid it on the scattered
sheets of paper which covered the table.</p>

<p>“It is only fair,” she observed, smilingly, “that I
should replace your paper-weight.”</p>

<p>She gave me her hand, which felt soft and cold,
like the skin of a serpent; and we departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1250">[Pg 1250]</span></p>

<p>We passed for some time with the velocity of an
arrow through a fluid and grayish expanse, in which
half-formed silhouettes flitted swiftly by us, to right
and left.</p>

<p>For an instant we saw only sky and sea.</p>

<p>A few moments later obelisks commenced to tower
in the distance: pylons and vast flights of steps
guarded by sphinxes became clearly outlined against
the horizon.</p>

<p>We had reached our destination.</p>

<p>The princess conducted me to a mountain of rose-colored
granite, in the face of which appeared an
opening so narrow and low that it would have been
difficult to distinguish it from the fissures in the rock,
had not its location been marked by two stelæ
wrought with sculptures.</p>

<p>Hermonthis kindled a torch, and led the way
before me.</p>

<p>We traversed corridors hewn through the living
rock: their walls, covered with hieroglyphics and
paintings of allegorical processions, might well have
occupied thousands of arms for thousands of years
in their formation;—these corridors, of interminable
length, opened into square chambers, in the midst of
which pits had been contrived, through which we descended
by cramp-irons or spiral stairways;—these
pits again conducted us into other chambers, opening
into other corridors, likewise decorated with painted
sparrow-hawks, serpents coiled in circles, the symbols
of the <em>tau</em> and <em>pedum</em>—prodigious works of art which
no living eye can ever examine—interminable legends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1251">[Pg 1251]</span>
of granite which only the dead have time to read
through all eternity.</p>

<p>At last we found ourselves in a hall so vast, so
enormous, so immeasurable, that the eye could not
reach its limits; files of monstrous columns stretched
far out of sight on every side, between which twinkled
livid stars of yellowish flame;—points of light
which revealed further depths incalculable in the darkness
beyond.</p>

<p>The Princess Hermonthis still held my hand, and
graciously saluted the mummies of her acquaintance.</p>

<p>My eyes became accustomed to the dim twilight;
and objects became discernible.</p>

<p>I beheld the kings of the subterranean races seated
upon thrones—grand old men, though dry, withered,
wrinkled like parchment, and blackened with naphtha
and bitumen—all wearing <em>pshents</em> of gold, and breast-plates
and gorgets glittering with precious stones;
their eyes immovably fixed like the eyes of sphinxes,
and their long beards whitened by the snow of centuries.
Behind them stood their peoples, in the stiff
and constrained posture enjoined by Egyptian art, all
eternally preserving the attitude prescribed by the
hieratic code. Behind these nations, the cats, ibixes,
and crocodiles cotemporary with them—rendered
monstrous of aspect by their swathing bands—mewed,
flapped their wings, or extended their jaws in a
saurian giggle.</p>

<p>All the Pharaohs were there—Cheops, Chephrenes,
Psammetichus, Sesostris, Amenotaph—all the dark
rulers of the pyramids and syrinxes:—on yet higher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1252">[Pg 1252]</span>
thrones sat Chronos and Xixouthros—who was contemporary
with the deluge; and Tubal Cain, who
reigned before it.</p>

<p>The beard of King Xixouthros had grown seven
times around the granite table, upon which he leaned,
lost in deep reverie—and buried in dreams.</p>

<p>Further back, through a dusty cloud, I beheld dimly
the seventy-two Preadamite Kings, with their seventy-two
peoples—forever passed away.</p>

<p>After permitting me to gaze upon this bewildering
spectacle a few moments, the Princess Hermonthis
presented me to her father Pharaoh, who favored me
with a most gracious nod.</p>

<p>“I have found my foot again!—I have found my
foot!” cried the princess, clapping her little hands together
with every sign of frantic joy: “it was this
gentleman who restored it to me.”</p>

<p>The races of Kemi, the races of Nahasi—all the
black, bronzed, and copper-colored nations repeated
in chorus:</p>

<p>“The Princess Hermonthis has found her foot
again!”</p>

<p>Even Xixouthros himself was visibly affected.</p>

<p>He raised his heavy eyelids, stroked his mustache
with his fingers, and turned upon me a glance weighty
with centuries.</p>

<p>“By Oms, the dog of Hell, and Tmei, daughter of
the Sun and of Truth! this is a brave and worthy
lad!” exclaimed Pharaoh, pointing to me with his
sceptre which was terminated with a lotus-flower.</p>

<p>“What recompense do you desire?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1253">[Pg 1253]</span></p>

<p>Filled with that daring inspired by dreams in which
nothing seems impossible, I asked him for the hand
of the Princess Hermonthis;—the hand seemed to me
a very proper antithetic recompense for the foot.</p>

<p>Pharaoh opened wide his great eyes of glass in
astonishment at my witty request.</p>

<p>“What country do you come from? and what is
your age?”</p>

<p>“I am a Frenchman; and I am twenty-seven years
old, venerable Pharaoh.”</p>

<p>“—Twenty-seven years old! and he wishes to
espouse the Princess Hermonthis, who is thirty centuries
old!”—cried out at once all the Thrones and
all the Circles of Nations.</p>

<p>Only Hermonthis herself did not seem to think
my request unreasonable.</p>

<p>“If you were even only two thousand years old,”
replied the ancient King, “I would willingly give you
the Princess; but the disproportion is too great; and,
besides, we must give our daughters husbands who
will last well: you do not know how to preserve yourselves
any longer; even those who died only fifteen
centuries ago are already no more than a handful of
dust;—behold! my flesh is solid as basalt; my bones
are bars of steel!</p>

<p>“I will be present on the last day of the world, with
the same body and the same features which I had
during my lifetime: my daughter Hermonthis will last
longer than a statue of bronze.</p>

<p>“Then the last particles of your dust will have been
scattered abroad by the winds; and even Isis herself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1254">[Pg 1254]</span>
who was able to find the atoms of Osiris, would scarce
be able to recompose your being.</p>

<p>“See how vigorous I yet remain, and how mighty
is my grasp,” he added, shaking my hand in the English
fashion with a strength that buried my rings in
the flesh of my fingers.</p>

<p>He squeezed me so hard that I awoke, and found
my friend Alfred shaking me by the arm to make me
get up.</p>

<p>“O you everlasting sleeper!—must I have you carried
out into the middle of the street, and fireworks
exploded in your ears? It is after noon; don’t you
recollect your promise to take me with you to see M.
Aguado’s Spanish pictures?”</p>

<p>“God! I forgot all, all about it,” I answered, dressing
myself hurriedly; “we will go there at once; I
have the permit lying there on my desk.”</p>

<p>I started to find it;—but fancy my astonishment
when I beheld, instead of the mummy’s foot I had
purchased the evening before, the little green paste
idol left in its place by the Princess Hermonthis!</p>

<p><em>As a writer of romance, Octave Feuillet
holds an absolutely unique place. For thirty
years he was the sole representative of that
delicate, high-minded school of writing which
owes to him, and to him alone, its rescue
from the realistic deluge.</em></p>

<p><em>He wrote “The Romance of a Poor Young
Man” “Julie de Trécœur,” and a host of
those exquisite “proverbes,” like “Circé,” that
delighted with their delicacy of observation,
the grace and spirit of their style; and yet
Feuillet has a most exacting realism of his
own, suave, urbane.</em></p>

<p><em>Octave Feuillet was born at Saint-Lô in
1821. His life was beautifully simple, coherent,
and filled with work. He wrote
many admirable plays, “Montjoye,” “Dalila,”
and others, and a sketch, “Le Curé de Bourron,”
almost perfect in its art, drawn from his
own observation as librarian at Fontainebleau.
In 1862 he was elected to the Academy and
in 1890 he died at Paris.</em></p>

<p class="center p1">
<span class="smcap">The Prince</span>, thirty years old.<br>
<span class="smcap">The Countess</span>, twenty-six years old.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>—<em>The Countess’s Boudoir.</em></p>

<p><em>The Countess.</em> How do you do, Prince?</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> What, not out? Ah, I am fortunate, upon
my word!</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> But you wrote me that you would
come—</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> I wrote you that, really? Ah, that’s odd.
Ah, ah, that is amusing! Madame, your mother is
well?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Very well—a little tired, that’s all—she’s
just going up to her room. But sit down.</p>

<p><em>Prince</em> (<em>seating himself</em>). Do you know what
brings me here?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> What?</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> I come to ask your advice. Imagine that
I dined at the Embassy. They got talking about little
drawing-room comedies, about <em>proverbes</em> or parables,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1258">[Pg 1258]</span>about those little things, you know, that they play at
private theatricals, and of the difficulty one experiences
in finding any that are not too hackneyed, that one
has not seen everywhere, and that are agreeable.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Yes—and then?</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Very well, then. I was in rather a good
humor; the spirit was upon me to compose during
the week one of those witty trifles. A wager, serious
enough, in fact, was connected with it. Briefly, since
yesterday I have been thinking, without boring myself
about other matters.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> And you have hit upon something?</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> I have not yet thought of anything. But
it will come. I conceived the idea of talking it over
with you. We will do the thing together, if you are
quite willing. It is very easy, you will see.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> But I don’t know, for my part, that it
is so very easy.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Positively. Nothing more simple. Will
you try?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Mon Dieu, I should like to—but you
must hold the pen.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> That’s understood.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> There, there’s paper and ink—blue ink;
is that all right?</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Blue ink will do no harm. (<em>Places himself
at a centre-table.</em>) There! Sit down in front of me,
like a muse, and let us begin without further ceremony,
will you?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Very willingly—but it’s rather embarrassing,
it seems to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1259">[Pg 1259]</span></p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Not at all. It’s very easy. Always the
same thing: Two people who chat about the rain and
about fine weather—more or less wittily, as it happens
to come. Well, are you ready?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Yes, yes—go on.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> First we must write down the persons:
“The Count, the Countess ——,” is it not?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Yes, of course—but is this to be a
<em>proverbe</em>?</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Yes, it’s a <em>proverbe</em>.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> But what <em>proverbe</em>? That must be decided
first.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Oh! Mon Dieu, why? It’s of no use—it
will develop itself in time—it will evolve naturally
from the conversation—it will be the finishing touch.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> So be it. Go on.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> “The Count, the Countess. First scene—”
Well?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Hé!</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> What is it they say?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> But what is the subject?</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> There is no subject! It is a witty trifle,
I told you—a nothing—an improvisation without substance—a
go-as-you-please conversation—I am not
proposing that you should write “The Misanthrope,”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
remember.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Yet it is necessary to know what they
are to talk about.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> But about nothing—about trifles—you
know how those things are!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1260">[Pg 1260]</span></p>
<p><em>Countess.</em> But, no, my dear Prince, I know nothing
about it—and no more do you, so it would seem.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Come, chère madame, do not let us quarrel.
We said, “The Count and the Countess,” is it not so?
They are in the country—and the Count is bored, I
suppose—</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Yes, that’s new enough.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> I do not say that it must be new, but at
any rate it is a subject, since you must have one. So
then, the Count is bored—and the Countess—the
Countess—</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Is bored too, perhaps?</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> It’s an idea, and with that combination, too,
may become original enough. They are both bored—Well,
you see, chère madame, we are progressing.
Let us pass on to the dialogue—That, that’s
the easiest—Once in the dialogue it will go by
itself—“The Count—” The Count—he enters,
doesn’t he?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Quite right.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> And in entering, he says—</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> He says?</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> What?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> I am asking you.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Well—he might say, for instance, “Always
alone, dear Countess?”</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> I see nothing inappropriate in that.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> It’s sufficiently the phrase of a bored man—“Always
alone, dear Countess?”</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> It’s a charming phrase—To which
the Countess, who is always alone, replies?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1261">[Pg 1261]</span></p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Wait—yes—perhaps—that is to say, no—that
will not do.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Instead of entering the diplomatic service
you ought to devote yourself to literature—with
your facility.</p>

<p><em>Prince</em> (<em>rising</em>). It is certain that I am too beastly
stupid—dumb as an animal—And then I am thinking
of something else—Oh, well, I am going!</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> No!</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> I assure you that at other times I had a
sort of wit—Inquire at the Embassy—they know—But
I am altogether changed—Good night, I am
going.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> No!</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> I am not going?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> No, I tell you!</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> So be it. (<em>He sits down again.</em>)</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Let us return. Where were we?—“The
Count, the Countess—”</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> The truth is you ought to consider me a
regular imbecile.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Is it the Count says that?</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> No, it is I.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Not at all—I find you only a little odd.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Odd! You are very kind—But no,
really; I beg of you to inquire at the Embassy—they
will tell you that I do not lack intelligence,
and that at other times I had even a sort of inspiration.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> But, my Prince, I have no need to inquire
at the Embassy, I have only to remember. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1262">[Pg 1262]</span>
known you to be extremely brilliant, several months
ago when you were making love to me.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Brilliant, no; but I was as good as another
at any rate.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Yes, yes, I insist—You were a brilliant
young man, sparkling, dreadful!—(<em>She rubs
her hands softly.</em>)</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> You are making fun of me—I was not
sparkling, but I had some vivacity—and that was but
two years ago! It is true that I had only just arrived
at Paris,—and that I had not yet passed under the
influence of the climate.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> You believe it was the climate—</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> What will you have? It must assuredly
have been something—It isn’t age—I am not
thirty years old—At any rate, I think I shall leave
Paris, and diplomacy as well—My mother sends
for me from Vienna—I received a letter from
her this morning—I wanted, also, to show it to
you—</p>

<p>(<em>He fumbles about in his coat pocket and pulls out
a letter half-tangled in some black lace.</em>)</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> What lace is that coming out of your
pocket?</p>

<p><em>Prince</em> (<em>confused</em>). Lace? Oh! Do you see
some lace?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> This—But I say, my Prince, is not
this one of my veils, here?</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> One of your veils—here?—Are you
sure?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Absolutely!—And I am going to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1263">[Pg 1263]</span>
it back, too, if you will allow me—That’s lace of
great price, if you have your doubts about it.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> I implore you to believe, indeed, madame,
that I did not attach a mercenary value to it. But
how do I come to have that veil about me?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> It is very easy to explain. I must have
left it at the Embassy on a visit, they charged you to
return it to me, and with your usual absent-mindedness,
you forgot the commission.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> That’s simple. I ask ten thousand pardons.
It is perfectly evident! You see I am not myself at
all any more. All my faculties—even my memory—are
weakening. It is high time I go to recover strength
in my native air. You see what my mother tells me?</p>

<p><em>Countess</em> (<em>running through the letter</em>). She has
the air of a noble woman, your mother.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Yes. We two are very fond of each other.
She advises me not to have too much success, poor
mother! She believes me always irresistible.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Then you have been so, my prince?</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Why, yes, a little, up to the day I had the
honor of meeting you—Well, what do you advise me?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> To go, since your mother wishes to see
you again.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> That’s my advice, too, and to tell you the
truth, I came this evening specially to bid you good-by.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> What! to bid me good-by?—And that
<em>proverbe</em>? What was the object of that joke?</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> That <em>proverbe</em>? Come, madame, I want
the last impression you receive of me to be pleasant.
You will laugh. Here is the history of that <em>proverbe</em>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1264">[Pg 1264]</span>
You remember well enough that which passed between
us two years ago, after I had vainly offered you my
heart and my hand. It so happened that if I wished to
continue to regard you as a friend, I must sternly
refrain from all allusions to a love definitely repulsed.
I gave you my word on the matter, and I expected
to have kept it scrupulously.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> That is true.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Well, then, I made a mistake there. Excuse
me, I swear to you that I am going. My discretion
and my reserve naturally made you believe
that I was cured of my love.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Naturally.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Yes. Well, it is a mistake. I love you
always. I love you like a fool, like a child, like an
angel, like a savage, as you will. Having decided
to go away, I wished first to make one supreme effort,
a desperate one. The idea of that <em>proverbe</em> came to
me. Under cover of that <em>proverbe</em> I promised myself
to set my feelings before you, with so much fire,
emotion, eloquence, wit, that you would be infallibly
softened, fascinated, and overcome. You have seen
how successful I was!—Isn’t it comic?—Now,
madame, adieu.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Adieu, Prince.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> One word more. Be gracious enough to
tell me why you refused to marry me. My proposal
was, in fact, perfectly honest and perfectly worthy of
acceptance. Why did you repulse it with so much
decision? Was it from caprice, from antipathy, or
did you have some serious reason?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1265">[Pg 1265]</span></p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> I had a serious reason.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> You loved some one?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> No one.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Then your heart was free, like your hand.
You had not been, you told me so yourself, particularly
happy with your husband—although he was charming,
from what they say.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> He was charming, altogether charming,
sparkling and irresistible—like you—in days gone by.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> In short, you were not happy; consequently,
you had no occasion to torment yourself if you
became unfaithful to the memory of the dead. As
for me I had a brilliant name, a fortune, a position.
At that time I was not ill and depressed as I am now.
I was tolerable in my person.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> Very handsome, indeed.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> I passed for a sufficiently lively talker. I
made court to you, if I remember, with—intelligence.</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> With much, much wit.</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> And you refused me!—Come, now, why?</p>

<p><em>Countess.</em> You do not guess?</p>

<p><em>Prince.</em> Not at all.</p>

<p><em>Countess</em> (<em>she takes his hand and looks him
tenderly in the eyes</em>). It is because I love dumb
animals, my friend!</p>

<p><em>Alexandre Dumas, the Younger, son of Alexandre
Dumas, was born at Paris in 1824, and
died at Marly-le-Roi in 1895. His first great
success came to him in 1848, with “La Dame
aux Camélias,” the romantic story of a
“woman with a past” reclaimed by love; afterward
dramatized with such success that it decided
his career. He still wrote novels and
short stories, but without his father’s imagination.
He was elected an Academician in
1874.</em></p>

<p><em>The younger Dumas inherited a strong, good
nature, weak enough to share in a few human
vices, strong enough to combat them; he was
a lover of order, elegance, and amateur in all
arts but his own. Aiming at social and moral
reformation, he was bold, logical, spiritual.
By reason of his depth of background and
knowledge of form, he ranks among the foremost
of the nineteenth century dramatists.</em></p>

</div>

<p class="center big1 p2b">BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS, FILS</p>


<p>Do you know La Piroche?
No. No more do I. So I shall not abuse
my privilege as an author by giving you a
description; especially since, between you and me be
it said, they are very tiresome, those descriptions.
Unless it be a question of the virgin forests of America,
as in Cooper, or of Meschaccbé,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> as in Chateaubriand,
that is to say, countries that are not close at
hand, and about which the imagination, to obtain a
clear vision of the details, must be assisted by those
poetical voyagers who have visited them, in general
descriptions are not of much consequence except to
be skipped by the reader. Literature has this advantage
over painting, sculpture, and music; the threefold
advantage of being able to paint by itself a picture in
a single word, to carve a statue in one phrase, to mold
a melody on one page; it must not abuse itself of that
privilege, and one should leave to the special arts a
little of their own prerogative. I own, then, for my
part, and for lack of better advice, that when I find
that I have to describe a country which every one has
seen, or every one could see, if it be near, if it does
not differ from our own, I prefer to leave to my reader
the pleasure of recalling it if he has seen it, or of imagining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1270">[Pg 1270]</span>
it if he does not yet know it. The reader
likes well enough to be left to do his share of the work
he is reading. This flatters him and makes him believe
that he is capable of doing the rest. Indeed, it is an
excellent thing to flatter your reader. Moreover, the
whole world in reality knows what the sea is like—a
plain, a forest, a blue sky, an effect of sun, an effect
of the moon, or an effect of storm. Of what use to
dwell upon it? It would be far better to trace a landscape
in one stroke of the brush like Rubens or Delacroix;
this should be said without comparison and
keep the whole value of your palette for the figures
you wish to reanimate. When one blackens with descriptions
page after page of paper, one doesn’t give
the reader an impression equal to that experienced by
the most artless bourgeois who walks through the Bois
de Vincennes on a soft April day, or by an unlettered
girl who strolls in June, on the arm of her fiancé, at
eleven o’clock at night through the shady vistas of
the woods of Romainville or the park of Enghien.
We all have in our minds and hearts a gallery of
landscapes made from memory, and which serves as
background for all the stories of the world. There
is but one word to use—day or night, winter or spring,
calm or storm, wood or plain—to evoke at once a most
finished landscape.</p>

<p>So I have only to tell you this: that at the moment
when the story I am about to tell you begins it is noon,
that it is May, that the highway we are going to enter
is bordered on the right with furze bushes, on the left
by the sea; you know at once all that I have not told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1271">[Pg 1271]</span>
you; that is to say, that the bushes are green, that
the sea is murmuring, that the sky is blue, that the
sun is warm, and that there is dust on the road.</p>

<p>I have only to add that this highway that winds
along the coast of Brittany runs from La Poterie to
La Piroche; that Piroche is a village about which I
know nothing, but which must be more or less like all
villages, that we are in the middle of the fifteenth
century, in 1418, and that two men, one older than
the other, one the father of the other, both peasants,
are following the highway mounted on two nags trotting
along comfortably enough for two nags under the
weight of two peasants.</p>

<p>“Shall we get there in time?” said the son.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is not to take place until two o’clock,”
replied the father, “and the sun marks but a quarter
after noon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I am curious to see that!”</p>

<p>“I can well believe it.”</p>

<p>“So he will be hanged in the armor that he stole?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How the devil did he get the idea of stealing
armor?”</p>

<p>“It’s not the idea that is hard to get—”</p>

<p>“It’s the armor,” interrupted the boy, who wanted
his share in making a part of that joke.</p>

<p>“And that, too, he didn’t get.”</p>

<p>“Was it fine armor?”</p>

<p>“Splendid, they say, all shining with gold.”</p>

<p>“And did they catch him as he was carrying it
away?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1272">[Pg 1272]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, you know as well as I do that armor like that
never goes astray without raising a great outcry; it
can’t escape its proper owner all by itself.”</p>

<p>“So, then, it was of iron?”</p>

<p>“They woke up in the château at the noise they
heard.”</p>

<p>“And did they arrest the man?”</p>

<p>“Not at once; they began by being afraid.”</p>

<p>“Of course, it’s always that way that people who
have been robbed begin when they are in the presence
of thieves; otherwise there would be no object in
being a thief.”</p>

<p>“No, nor any pleasant excitement in being robbed!
But those brave folks had no idea that it was an affair
of robbery.”</p>

<p>“Of what, then?”</p>

<p>“Of a ghost. That wretched, most vigorous fellow
was carrying the armor in front of him, holding his
head at the height of the loins of said armor so effectively
that he acquired gigantic proportions in the
corridor where he passed. Add to this a clattering
noise which the rascal made behind him, and you will
appreciate the fright of the valets. But, unfortunately
for him, he woke up the Seigneur of La Piroche, he
who has fear of neither the dead nor the living,
who easily, and all by himself, arrested the thief and
handed him over, bound, to his well-deserved justice.”</p>

<p>“And his well-deserved justice?”</p>

<p>“The condemned man is to be hanged clothed in
the armor.”</p>

<p>“Why that clause in the sentence?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1273">[Pg 1273]</span></p>

<p>“Because the Seigneur of La Piroche is not only a
brave captain, but a man of common sense and of
spirit, who wished to draw from this just condemnation
an example for others and an advantage for himself.
Why, don’t you know that whatever touches a
hanged man becomes a talisman for him who possesses
it? So the Seigneur of La Piroche has ordered
that the thief should be hanged dressed in his armor, so
as to reclaim it when the man is dead and have a talisman
to wear during our next wars.”</p>

<p>“That is very ingenious.”</p>

<p>“I should think so.”</p>

<p>“Let’s make haste, for I am so anxious to see the
poor man hanged.”</p>

<p>“We have plenty of time! We must not wear our
beasts out. We are not going to stop at La Piroche;
we will have to go on a league farther, and then
return to La Poterie.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but our beasts will rest for five or six hours,
for we do not return until evening.”</p>

<p>The father and son continued on their way, talking,
and half an hour later they reached La Piroche.</p>

<p>As the father had said, they arrived on time. Have
fathers always the privilege of being right?</p>

<p>There was an immense concourse of people on the
great square in front of the château, for it was there
that the scaffold had been erected, a splendid gallows,
in faith, of sound oak, not very high, it is true, since
it was intended for a wretched, obscure criminal, but
high enough, nevertheless, for death to do its work
between earth and the end of the rope which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1274">[Pg 1274]</span>
swinging in the fresh sea breeze like an eel hanging by
its tail.</p>

<p>The condemned man was certain of having a beautiful
view at the moment of death, for he was to die
with his face turned toward the ocean. If this view
could be any consolation to him, so much the better,
but, for my part, I doubt it.</p>

<p>And all the while the sea was blue, and from time
to time between the azure of the sky and that of the
sea floated a white cloud, like an angel on its way to
heaven, but whose long robes still trailed upon the
earth it was quitting.</p>

<p>The two companions approached as near as possible
to the scaffold, so as to miss nothing that was
going on, and, like all the rest, they waited, having
this advantage over the others, that they were mounted
on two nags and could see better with less fatigue.</p>

<p>They had not long to wait.</p>

<p>At a quarter of two the gates of the château opened,
and the condemned man appeared, preceded by the
guards of the Seigneur of La Piroche and followed
by the executioner.</p>

<p>The thief was dressed in the stolen armor and was
mounted reversed on the bare back of a jackass. He
rode with vizor down and head lowered. They had
tied his hands behind his back, and if they wish for
our opinion in the matter we have no hesitation in
saying that, judging by his position, in default of his
face, which could not be seen, he ought to have been
very ill at ease, and indulging at that moment in very
sad reflections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1275">[Pg 1275]</span></p>

<p>They conducted him to the side of the scaffold, and
a moving picture hardly pleasant for him began to
silhouette itself against the blue sky. The hangman
set his ladder against the scaffold, and the
chaplain of the Seigneur of La Piroche, mounted
on a prepared platform, delivered the sentence of
justice.</p>

<p>The condemned man did not move. One might
have said that he had given the spectators the slip
by dying before he was hanged.</p>

<p>They called to him to descend from his ass and
deliver himself to the hangman.</p>

<p>He did not move. We understand his hesitation.</p>

<p>Then the hangman took him by the elbows, lifted
him off the ass, and set him upright on the ground.</p>

<p>Fine fellow, that hangman!</p>

<p>When we say that he set him upright, we do not
lie. But we would lie in saying that he remained as
they placed him. He had in two minutes jumped
two-thirds of the alphabet; that is to say, in vulgar
parlance, that instead of standing straight like an I,
he became zigzag like a Z.</p>

<p>During this time the chaplain finished reading the
sentence.</p>

<p>“Have you any request to make?” he asked of the
culprit.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the unfortunate, in a voice sad
and low.</p>

<p>“What do you ask?”</p>

<p>“I ask for pardon.”</p>

<p>I do not know if the word “farceur” was invented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1276">[Pg 1276]</span>
in those days, but then or never was the time to invent
it and to speak it.</p>

<p>The Seigneur of La Piroche shrugged his shoulders
and ordered the executioner to do his duty.</p>

<p>The latter made ready to mount the ladder leaning
against the gibbet, which, impassive, was about to
draw with extended arm the soul out of a body, and
he attempted to make the condemned mount in front
of him, but it was not an easy thing to do. One does
not know, in general, what obstacles those condemned
to death will put in the way of their dying.</p>

<p>The hangman and the man there had the air of
passing civilities one to another. It was a question
of who should go first.</p>

<p>The hangman, to make him mount on his ladder,
returned to the method he employed in making him
descend from his ass. He seized him around the middle
of his body, balanced him on the third rung of the
ladder, and began to push him up from beneath.</p>

<p>“Bravo!” cried the crowd.</p>

<p>He ought to have mounted well.</p>

<p>Then the executioner adroitly slipped the running
noose, which adorned the end of the rope, around
the neck of the culprit, and, giving the latter a vigorous
kick in the back, he flung him out into space,
which strongly resembled Eternity.</p>

<p>An immense clamor greeted this looked-for dénouement,
and a shudder passed through the crowd.
Whatever may be the crime he has committed, the
man who dies is always at the moment greater than
those who watch him die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1277">[Pg 1277]</span></p>

<p>The hanged man swung for three or four minutes
at the end of his rope, as he had a right to do,
danced, wriggled, then hung motionless and rigid.</p>

<p>The Z had become an I again.</p>

<p>They gazed a while longer on the culprit, whose
gilded armor glistened in the sun, then the spectators
divided themselves, little by little, into groups, and
went their way home, chatting about the event.</p>

<p>“Pooh! a horrid thing is death!” said the son of the
peasant, as he continued his journey with his father.</p>

<p>“In good faith, to hang one for not having succeeded
in stealing a piece of armor, that’s expensive. What
do you think?”</p>

<p>“I wonder, I do, what they would have done to him
if he had really stolen the armor?”</p>

<p>“They would not have done anything to him, for if
he had really stolen the armor he would have been able
to escape from the château. Then, possibly, he would
not have returned to be arrested.”</p>

<p>“Yet he is punished more for a crime that he has
not committed than he would have been if he had committed
the crime!”</p>

<p>“But he had the intention of committing it.”</p>

<p>“And the intention was accounted as a fact—”</p>

<p>“That is perfectly just.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t pretty to look at.”</p>

<p>And since they found themselves on rising ground,
the two companions turned to contemplate for the last
time the silhouette of the unfortunate.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later they entered the little town
where, save the mark! they were to receive certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1278">[Pg 1278]</span>
moneys, and which they were to leave that evening in
order to accomplish the return home that same night.</p>

<p>On the morrow, at break of day, the guards sallied
out from the château of La Piroche for the purpose
of taking down the corpse of the hanging man, from
which they intended to recover the armor of the Seigneur,
but they discovered something which they had
been far from anticipating, that is to say, the gibbet
was there, as always, but the hanged man was not
there.</p>

<p>The two guards rubbed their eyes, believing themselves
to be dreaming, but the thing was very real.
No more hanged man, and naturally no more armor.</p>

<p>And what was extraordinary, the rope was neither
broken nor cut, but just in the condition it was before
receiving the condemned.</p>

<p>The two guards ran to announce this news to the
Seigneur of La Piroche. He was not willing to believe
it, and proceeded to assure himself of the truth
of the facts. So puissant a seigneur was he that he
was convinced the hanged man would reappear for
him there; but he saw what all the rest had seen.</p>

<p>What had become of the dead? For the condemned
had certainly died the day before, before the eyes of
the whole village.</p>

<p>Had another thief profited by the night to get possession
of the armor that covered the corpse?</p>

<p>Possibly—but in taking the armor he would naturally
leave the corpse, for which he had no use.</p>

<p>Had the friends or relations of the culprit wished to
give him Christian burial?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1279">[Pg 1279]</span></p>

<p>Nothing impossible in that if it were not for the fact
that the culprit had neither friends nor relations, and
that people who had had religious sentiments like that
would have taken the culprit and left the armor. That,
then, was no longer to be thought of. What should
one believe, then?</p>

<p>The Seigneur of La Piroche was in despair. He
was all for his armor. He made promise of a reward
of ten gold <em>écus</em> to any one who should deliver to him
the thief, dressed as he was in dying.</p>

<p>They ransacked the houses; they found nothing.</p>

<p>No one presented himself.</p>

<p>They caused a sage of the town of Rennes to
be sent for, and they propounded this question
to him:</p>

<p>“In what way does a dead man who has been hanged
manage to free himself from the rope that holds him
in the air by the neck?”</p>

<p>The sage demanded eight days to ponder over the
question, at the termination of which he replied:</p>

<p>“He can not do it.”</p>

<p>Then they propounded this second question:</p>

<p>“A thief, unsuccessful in stealing while alive, and
having been condemned to death for stealing, can he
steal after his death?”</p>

<p>The sage replied:</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>He was asked how it could be done. He replied
that he knew nothing about it.</p>

<p>He was the greatest sage of his time.</p>

<p>They sent him home and contented themselves with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1280">[Pg 1280]</span>
believing, for those were the days of witchcraft, that
the thief was a wizard.</p>

<p>Then they said masses to exorcise that evil spirit,
which was without doubt taking his revenge upon the
Seigneur who had ordered his death and upon those
who had come to see him die.</p>

<p>A month passed in fruitless search.</p>

<p>The gibbet still stood there as always, humiliated,
gloomy, and discredited. Never had a gibbet committed
such a breach of confidence.</p>

<p>The Seigneur of La Piroche continued to clamor
for his armor from man, God, and the devil.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>At last he was beginning, without a doubt, to make
the best of this strange event, and of the loss which
had been the result, when one morning, as he was waking,
he heard a great commotion on the square where
the execution had taken place. He was making ready
to inform himself of what was passing when his chaplain
entered the room.</p>

<p>“Monseigneur,” said he, “do you know what has
happened?”</p>

<p>“No, but I am going to ask.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you, I can.”</p>

<p>“What is it, then?”</p>

<p>“A miracle from heaven!”</p>

<p>“Really!”</p>

<p>“The hanged man—”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“He is there!”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1281">[Pg 1281]</span></p>

<p>“On the scaffold.”</p>

<p>“Hanging?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monseigneur.”</p>

<p>“In his armor?”</p>

<p>“In your armor.”</p>

<p>“True, for it <em>is</em> mine. And is he dead?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely dead—only—”</p>

<p>“Only what?”</p>

<p>“Did he have spurs on when they hanged him?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, Monseigneur, he has them, and in place of
having the casque on his head, he has placed it with
great care at the foot of the gibbet, and left his head
hanging uncovered.”</p>

<p>“Let us see, Mr. Chaplain, let us see, straight off!”</p>

<p>The Seigneur of La Piroche ran to the square
crowded with the curious. The neck of the hanged
man had passed again into the running noose, the
corpse was there at the end of the rope, and the armor
was there on the corpse.</p>

<p>It was astounding. So they proclaimed it a miracle.</p>

<p>“He has repented,” said one, “and has come to hang
himself over again.”</p>

<p>“He has been there all the time,” said another; “only
we did not see him.”</p>

<p>“But why has he got spurs?” asked a third.</p>

<p>“No doubt, because he has come from afar and
wished to return in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“I know well, for my part, that far or near, I would
not have needed to put on spurs, for I would not have
come back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1282">[Pg 1282]</span></p>

<p>And they laughed, and they stared at the ugly face
the dead man made.</p>

<p>As for the Seigneur of La Piroche, he thought of
nothing but of making sure that the thief was quite
dead, and of securing his armor.</p>

<p>They cut down the corpse and stripped it; then,
once despoiled, they hung it up again, and the ravens
investigated so thoroughly that at the end of two days
it was all jagged, at the end of eight days it had only
the appearance of a rag, and at the end of fifteen days
it had no longer the appearance of anything at all; or,
if it did resemble anything, it was only those impossible
hanged men we used to make pictures of on the first
page of our text-book, and below which we wrote the
amphibious quatrain, half Latin, half French:</p>

<p>But what had the hanged man been doing during
his month of absence? How did it happen that he
escaped, and, having escaped, that he hanged himself
again?</p>

<p>We will give below the three versions which have
been presented to us.</p>

<p>A magician, a pupil of Merlin, declared that if at the
moment of dying the culprit has had the will to disappear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1283">[Pg 1283]</span>
and the ability to absorb his body into his will, the
will being an immaterial thing, invisible, and impalpable,
the body, which finds itself absorbed by it, and consequently
hidden in it, becomes by that means also
impalpable, immaterial, and invisible, and that if the
body of a thief has reappeared at the end of a month,
and at the end of a rope, it is because at that supreme
moment his will, troubled by his conscience, has not
had sufficient force for eternal absorption.</p>

<p>This may not be a good version, but it is one.</p>

<p>The theologians affirm that the culprit did succeed
in vanishing, but that, pursued by remorse and being
in haste to reconcile himself with God, he could not
endure the life longer than one month, and, full of
repentance, came to execute upon himself that justice
which he had escaped the first time.</p>

<p>That, perhaps, is not the true version, but it is always
Christian logic, and as a Christian we will not
dismiss it altogether.</p>

<p>Finally, they declared that our two peasants in returning
home that evening, and passing close to the
gibbet, heard lamentations, a rattling, and something
like a prayer; that they piously crossed themselves
and demanded what was the matter; that
they received no reply, but the lamentations continued,
and it seemed to them that they came from the corpse
that was above their heads. Then they took the ladder
that the hangman had left at the foot of the scaffold,
rested it against the arm of the gibbet, and the son,
having mounted to the level of the condemned,
said to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1284">[Pg 1284]</span></p>

<p>“Is it you who are making these complaints, poor
man?”</p>

<p>The condemned gathered all his strength together
and said:</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then you are still alive?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You repent of your crime?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I will loosen you, and since the Evangelist
commands us to give succor to those who suffer, and
that you suffer, I am going to succor you and bring
you to life in order to bring you to good. God prefers
a soul that repents to a corpse that expiates.”</p>

<p>Then the father and the son cut down the dying
man, and saw how it was that he still lived. The
rope, instead of tightening about the neck of the thief,
had tightened at the base of the casque so effectually
that the culprit was suspended but not strangled, and,
occupying with his head a kind of vantage-point in
the interior of the casque, he was able to breathe and
to keep alive up to the time our two companions
passed by.</p>

<p>The latter took him down and carried him home
with them, where they gave him into the care of the
mother and the young daughter.</p>

<p>But he who has stolen will steal.</p>

<p>There were but two things to steal at the peasant’s,
for the money he had brought back with him was not
in his house. These two things were his horse and his
daughter, a fair-haired girl of sixteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1285">[Pg 1285]</span></p>

<p>The ex-hanged decided to steal both the one and the
other, for he was covetous of the horse and had fallen
in love with the daughter.</p>

<p>So one night he saddled the horse, buckled on the
spurs to make him ride faster, and went to take the
young girl while she was asleep, and lift her up on to
the crupper.</p>

<p>But the girl awoke and cried out.</p>

<p>The father and the son came running up. The thief
tried to escape, but he was too late. The young girl
told about the attempt of the hanged man; and the
father and the son, seeing well that no repentance was
to be expected from such a man, resolved to execute
justice upon him, but more effectually than the Seigneur
of La Piroche had allowed himself to do it.
They bound the thief to the horse which he had saddled
himself, led him to the square of La Piroche, and
strung him up there where he had been hanged, but
placed his casque on the ground to make sure that he
should not vanish again; then they returned home
quietly.</p>

<p>There is the third version. I do not know why I
believe it to be the most probable, and that you would
do well, like me, to give it preference over the other
two.</p>

<p>As for the Seigneur of La Piroche, as soon as he
had secured a real talisman, he went happily off to the
wars, where he was the first to be killed.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>On the day before Christmas of the year 1832,
my friend Wilfred, with his double-bass
slung over his back, and I, with my violin
under my arm, started to walk from the Black Forest
to Heidelberg. It was unusually snowy weather; as
far as we could see across the great, deserted plain,
there was no trace of road nor path. The wind kept
up its harsh aria with monotonous persistency, and
Wilfred, with his flattened wallet at his belt, and the
vizor of his cap drawn over his eyes, moved on before
me, straddling the drifts with his long, heron
legs, and whistling a gay tune to keep up his spirits.
Now and then, he would turn around with a waggish
smile, and cry: “Comrade, let’s have the waltz from
‘Robin,’ I feel like dancing.” A burst of laughter followed
these words, and then the good fellow would
resume his march courageously. I followed on as
well as I could, up to my knees in snow, and I felt
a sense of melancholy take possession of me.</p>

<p>The spires of Heidelberg began to appear on the
extreme horizon, and we hoped to reach there before
nightfall. It was then about five o’clock in the afternoon,
and great flakes of snow were whirling through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1290">[Pg 1290]</span>the gray atmosphere. Suddenly we heard the sound
of a horse approaching from behind us. When the
rider was within twenty yards of us, he moderated his
speed, studying us meanwhile with a sidelong glance.
We returned his gaze.</p>

<p>Picture to yourself a large man, with reddish hair
and beard, in a three-cornered hat and loose fox-skin
pelisse; his arms buried to the elbows in fur gloves.
He carried a handsome valise behind him, resting on
the haunches of his powerful stallion. He was evidently
some alderman or burgomaster or personage of
like importance.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho! my good fellows!” he cried; “you are
on your way to Heidelberg to perform, I see.” Wilfred
surveyed the traveler from the corner of his eye,
and replied briefly: “Is that of any interest to you,
sir?” “Yes, for in that case I wish to give you a bit
of advice.” “Advice?” “Precisely; if you wish it.”
Wilfred started on without replying. I noticed that
the traveler’s appearance was like that of an enormous
cat; his ears wide apart, his eyelids half closed, with a
bristling mustache, and a fatherly, almost caressing
manner. “My friend,” he continued, addressing himself
to me, “frankly, you will do well to retrace your
steps.” “Why so, sir?” “The great Maestro Pimenti
has just now announced a concert to take place at
Heidelberg on Christmas day. The entire city will be
there, and you will not earn a kreutzer.” At this point,
Wilfred turned around ill-humoredly: “We care not
a sou for your Maestro nor all the Pimentis in Christendom,”
he said; “look at this young fellow here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1291">[Pg 1291]</span>
without even the sign of a beard on his chin! He has
never yet played outside of the ale-houses of the Black
Forest, for the woodcutters and charcoal-women to
dance; and yet this boy, with his long yellow curls
and big blue eyes, defies all your Italian impostors.
His left hand is possessed of inimitable melody,
grace, and suppleness, and his right of a power to
draw the bow, that the Almighty rarely accords us
mortals.”</p>

<p>“Oh! ho! Indeed!” returned the other. “It is just
as I tell you,” Wilfred replied, and he resumed his
pace, blowing on his fingers that were red with the
cold. I saw that he was ridiculing the horseman, who
continued to follow us at an easy trot. We continued
thus for a full half mile in silence. Suddenly the
stranger said to us abruptly: “Whatever skill you may
possess, go back to the Black Forest; we have vagabonds
enough in Heidelberg without you to increase
the number. I give you good advice, particularly
under the existing circumstances; you will do well
to profit by it.”</p>

<p>Wilfred, now thoroughly out of patience, was about
to reply, but the traveler, urging his horse into a gallop,
had already crossed the broad Avenue d’Electeur.
An immense flock of crows flew up from the plain and
seemed to be following him, filling the heavens with
their cawing. We reached Heidelberg at about seven
o’clock, and we did indeed see Pimenti’s magnificent
posters on all the walls of the city, which read: “Grand
Concert Solo.”</p>

<p>That same evening in visiting the various inns, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1292">[Pg 1292]</span>
met many old comrades from the Black Forest, who
engaged us to play in their troupe. There was old
Bremer, the ’cellist, his two sons, Ludwig and Karl,
both good second violins; Heinrich Siebel, the clarionet
player, and Bertha with her harp; Wilfred with
his double-bass and I with my violin made up the
number. We agreed to travel together after the
Christmas concert and divide the proceeds among us.
Wilfred had already hired a room for us both on the
sixth floor of the Pied de Mouton Tavern, which stood
half-way down the Holdergrasse, and for it he was to
pay four kreutzers a day. Properly speaking, it was
nothing but a garret, but fortunately there was a stove
in it, and we lighted a fire to dry ourselves.</p>

<p>As we were comfortably seated, toasting chestnuts
over the fire and enjoying a jug of wine, little Annette,
the housemaid, appeared in a black calico dress and
velvet turban, with rosy cheeks and lips like a cluster
of cherries. She came running up the stairs, gave a
hasty knock and threw herself joyfully into my arms.
I had known the pretty little girl for a long time; we
were of the same village, and if truth must be told,
her sparkling eyes and frolicsome ways had quite won
my heart. “I came up to have a little talk with you,”
she said, dropping into a chair. “I saw you come up
a moment ago and here I am.”</p>

<p>She began to chatter away, asking for this one or
that one of the village and hardly giving me time to
reply. Every now and then she would pause and look
at me with the greatest tenderness. We might have
continued thus until the next morning had not Dame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1293">[Pg 1293]</span>
Grédel Dick begun to call from the foot of the stairs:
“Annette! Annette! Are you never coming?” “Right
away, ma’am!” answered the poor child reluctantly.
She tapped me lightly on the cheek and ran toward
the door; but just as she was crossing the threshold,
she suddenly stopped. “By the way,” she cried, “I
was forgetting to tell you; but perhaps you have heard
about it?” “About what?” “The death of our precentor,
Zahn.” “But how does that affect us?” “To
be sure; only see that your passport is all right. Tomorrow
morning at eight o’clock they will come to
examine it. Everybody is being arrested in the last
fortnight. The precentor was assassinated last night
in the library of Saint Christopher’s Chapel, and only
a week ago, old Ulmet Elias, the sacrificer, was similarly
murdered in the Rue des Juifs. Some days before
that Christina Hâas, the old midwife, was also
killed, as well as the agate dealer Seligmann of the
Rue Durlach. So look out for yourself, dear Kasper,
and see that your passport is all right.”</p>

<p>While she was speaking, Dame Grédel’s voice came
again from below: “Annette! will you come here?
The good-for-nothing child, leaving me to do all the
work!”</p>

<p>And the sound of men’s voices calling for wine,
beer, ham, or sausages mingled with her own.
Further delay was out of the question. Annette hastened
down the stairs, crying as she went: “Goodness,
ma’am! what has happened? One would think that
the house were afire!” Wilfred crossed the room and
closed the door behind her; then returning to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1294">[Pg 1294]</span>
chair, we looked at each other, not without a feeling
of apprehension.</p>

<p>“That is singular news,” he said; “your passport is
all right, I suppose?” “Certainly.” And I produced
my papers. “Good! Mine is too, for I had it made
out just before leaving. But nevertheless, these murders
do not augur us any good. I am afraid we shall
not be able to do much business here; many of the
families will be in mourning; and then, too, the bother
and pettifogging of the authorities.” “Pshaw! you
take too gloomy a view of it,” I replied.</p>

<p>We continued to discuss these singular happenings
until after midnight. The glow from our little stove
lighted up the angle of the roof, the square window
with its three cracked panes, the straw strewn about
the floor, the blackened beams propped against each
other, and the little firwood table that cast its uncertain
shadow upon the worm-eaten ceiling. From time
to time, a mouse, enticed by the warmth, would dart
like an arrow along the wall. The wind howled in the
chimney and whirled the snow about the gutters. I
was dreaming of Annette; the silence was complete.
Suddenly Wilfred exclaimed, throwing off his jacket:
“It is time for sleep. Put another stick on the fire
and we will go to bed!” “We can’t do better than
that,” I replied. So saying, I drew off my boots, and
a moment later we were stretched out on the straw
with the coverlid tucked under our chins and a log
under our heads for a pillow. Wilfred lost no time
in getting to sleep. The light from the stove flickered
and trembled; the wind redoubled its force outside,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1295">[Pg 1295]</span>
and as I lay thus with a sense of perfect contentment,
I, too, dozed off. At about two o’clock in the morning
I was awakened by a strange noise. I thought at
first that it was a cat running along the gutter, but,
putting my ear to the wall, my uncertainty was at
once dispelled; somebody was walking on the roof.
I nudged Wilfred. “Sh!” he whispered, pressing my
hand; he had heard it, too. The firelight was casting
its last shadows on the decrepit walls. I was considering
whether I would get up or not, when the little
window, held only by a bit of brick, slowly opened. A
pale face with shining eyes, red hair, and quivering
cheeks appeared in the opening and gazed into the
interior of the chamber. Our fear was so great that
we hadn’t strength left to cry out. At length the man
glided through the sash and let himself down into the
loft without a sound. The man, short and thick-set,
the muscles of his face contracted like a tiger about to
spring, was none other than the ingenuous person who
had volunteered his advice on the road to Heidelberg.
But how different he seemed to us now! In spite of
the bitter cold, he was in his shirt sleeves, dressed
only in a pair of breeches, woolen stockings, and silver
buckled shoes. A long, blood-stained knife glittered
in his hand.</p>

<p>Wilfred and I thought our last hour had surely
come. But he did not appear to see us in the oblique
shadow of the loft, notwithstanding that the fire
started up again in the cold draft from the open
window. He squatted down on a chair and began to
shiver in a strange manner. Suddenly he fixed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1296">[Pg 1296]</span>
yellowish-green eyes upon me; his nostrils dilated and
he watched me for a full minute, while the blood froze
in my veins. Then turning toward the stove, he gave
a hoarse cough, like the purring of a cat, without moving
a muscle of his face. He drew a large watch from
his breeches pocket, made a gesture as if looking at
the time, and either inadvertently or purposely laid
it on the table. This done, he rose as if undecided,
looked doubtfully at the window, hesitated, and finally
disappeared through the door, leaving it wide open
behind him. I sprang up to turn the lock; already the
man’s footsteps creaked on the staircase two floors
below. An irresistible curiosity asserted itself over
my fear, and hearing a window open, which looked
upon the court, I approached the sash of the little
winding staircase on the same side of the house. The
courtyard, from where I stood, lay at a dizzy depth,
and a wall from fifty to sixty feet high divided it. On
the right of the wall was the yard of a pork butcher;
on the left, the inn yard of the Pied de Mouton. The
top of this wall, which was overgrown with damp
mosses and that sort of vegetation that thrives in dark
places, extended in a straight line from the window,
which the man had just opened, to the roof of a large,
sombre-looking dwelling, built in the rear of the Bergstrasse.</p>

<p>I took all this in at a glance while the moon shone
between the heavy, snow-laden clouds, and I shuddered
as I saw the man flee along the wall, his head
bent forward and the knife still in his hand, while the
wind howled lugubriously around him. He reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1297">[Pg 1297]</span>
the opposite roof and disappeared. I thought I must
be dreaming. For some moments I stood there, open-mouthed
with wonder, my breast bare, and hair tossed
about, drenched by the sleet that fell from the roof.
At length recovering from my bewilderment, I returned
to the loft and found Wilfred, who looked at
me with a haggard expression and was mumbling a
prayer. I hastened to bolt the door, dress myself, and
replenish the fire.</p>

<p>“Well,” said my comrade, sitting up. “Well,” I
rejoined, “we have escaped this time, but if that fellow
didn’t see us, it was only because our time has not
yet come.” “You are right!” he cried. “He is one
of the murderers Annette spoke of. Great Heavens!
What a face! And what a knife!” And he fell back
on the straw.</p>

<p>I emptied at a draft what wine still remained in the
jug, and then, as the fire started up again, diffusing
a grateful warmth through the chamber, and the lock
appeared sufficiently strong, my courage began to revive.
But the watch was still there and the man might
return for it. The thought filled us with horror.</p>

<p>“Well, what is our next move?” asked Wilfred.
“The best thing we can do is to strike out at once for
the Black Forest.” “Why so?” “I have no further
desire to figure on the double-bass; you may do as you
like.” “Why should we leave? We have committed
no crime.” “Speak low!” he replied, “that one word
‘crime’ might hang us. We poor devils are made to
serve as examples for others. They don’t bother their
heads much to find out whether we are guilty or not.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1298">[Pg 1298]</span>
If they should discover that watch here, it would be
enough.” “Look here, Wilfred! It won’t do to lose
your head! A crime has undoubtedly been committed
in this neighborhood, but what should honest men do
under the circumstances? Instead of running away
from Justice, they should try to aid it.” “How aid
it?” “The simplest way would be to take this watch
to the bailiff and tell him what has passed.” “Never!
I wouldn’t even dare to touch it!” “Very well, I will
take it myself, but now let’s go back to bed and try
to get some more sleep if we can.” “I don’t care to
sleep.” “Well, light your pipe, then, and we will talk
while we wait for daylight. Let’s go downstairs,
there may be some one there still.” “I would rather
stay here.” “All right.” And we sat down again
before the fire.</p>

<p>As soon as dawn appeared, I took the watch from
the table. It was a fine one with minute and second
hands. Wilfred seemed somewhat reassured. “Kasper,”
he said, “on second thoughts, it seems more suitable
for me to go to the bailiff. You are too young
to take part in such matters. You would make a mess
of it when you tried to explain the affair.” “Just as
you like,” I replied. “Yes, it would look odd for a
man of my years to send a mere child in my place.”
“Very good; I understand.”</p>

<p>He took the watch, but I believe that only his pride
drove him to this resolution. He would have been
ashamed to show less courage than I before his comrades.
We went down from the loft in a thoughtful
mood. As we crossed the alleyway that comes out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1299">[Pg 1299]</span>
on the Rue Saint Christopher, we heard the clicking
of glasses. I recognized the voice of old Bremer and
his sons, Ludwig and Karl. “By Jove,” said I, “it
wouldn’t be a bad idea to take a glass before we start.”
I pushed open the door of the tap-room as I spoke,
and we found all our company gathered there, their
instruments variously deposited about the room. We
were received with shouts of satisfaction and places
were quickly made for us at the table. “Ho! Good
morning, comrades,” said Bremer; “more snow and
wind. All the taverns are full of people, and every
bottle that is opened means a florin in our pockets.”
I saw little Annette looking as fresh and fair as a rose,
and smiling fondly at me with her lips and eyes. This
sight reanimated me. It was I who got the daintiest
morsels, and whenever she approached to set a glass
of wine at my elbow, she touched me caressingly on
the shoulder, and I thought, with a beating heart, of
the days when we used to go chestnutting together.
But in spite of this, the pale face of our strange visitor
of the night before recurred to me from time to time,
and made me tremble. I looked at Wilfred; he, too,
seemed thoughtful.</p>

<p>Eight o’clock came and our party was about to start
out, when the door was thrown open, and three big
fellows, with lead-colored complexions, their eyes
shining like rats, and their hats awry, appeared on
the threshold, followed by several others of a like description.
One of them, with a razor-back nose, and
with a heavy club bound to his wrist, stepped forward,
crying: “Your passports, gentlemen!” Each one hastened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1300">[Pg 1300]</span>
to comply with the request. Unfortunately,
Wilfred, who stood near the stove, was seized with
a sudden trembling. The officer’s experienced eye
detected his agitation, and as he paused in his reading
to give him a questioning look, my comrade conceived
the unlucky idea of slipping the watch into his boot;
but before it had reached its destination, the official
slapped his hand against the other’s hip, and said
jeeringly: “Something seems to trouble you here.”
To everybody’s amazement, Wilfred was seized with
a fainting spell and dropped upon a bench pale as
death. Without further ceremony, Madoc, the Chief
of Police, pulled up his trousers’ leg and drew out the
watch with a burst of evil laughter. He had no sooner
glanced at it, however, than he became sober, and,
turning to his men, he cried in a terrible voice: “Let
no one leave the room! We have caught the whole
band at last! Look! this is the watch of Dean Daniel
Van den Berg. Bring hither the handcuffs!” This
order chilled us to the marrow. A tumult followed,
and I, believing that we were lost, slid under a bench
near the wall. As I was watching them chain the
hands of poor old Bremer and his sons, Karl and
Ludwig, together with Heinrich and Wilfred, I felt
Annette’s little hand brush against my cheek and she
drew me gently toward her—slowly and quietly toward
the open cellar door. I was unnoticed in the general
confusion; I slipped within; the door closed behind
me. It was but the matter of a second. Scarcely had
I concealed myself, before I heard my poor comrades
depart; then all became silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1301">[Pg 1301]</span></p>

<p>I will leave you to imagine the nature of my reflections
during an entire day, crouched down behind
a wine cask with my legs gathered under me, and realizing
that if a dog should enter the cellar, if the landlady
should take the notion to come downstairs to fill
a pitcher, if the cask should run out before night and
were to be replaced; in short, if the slightest thing
went amiss, it would be all up with me. All these
thoughts and a thousand others passed through my
mind, and I fancied that I already saw my comrades
being led to execution. Little Annette, no less anxious
than myself, closed the door prudently each time
that she came up from the cellar. At last, I heard
the old woman cry: “Leave the door open! Are you
mad to lose half your time in shutting it?” After
that the door remained ajar, and from my nook in
the shadows I could see the tables gradually filling
with new customers.</p>

<p>Stories, discussions, and exclamations concerning
the famous band of robbers reached my ears. “Oh!
the rascals!” cried one; “thank Heaven they are
caught. What a scourge they have been to Heidelberg!
No one dared risk himself in the streets after
ten o’clock, and even business was beginning to suffer;
but now things are changed and in a fortnight it will
all be forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Those musicians of the Black Forest are a lot of
bandits!” chimed in another; “they make their way
into the houses under pretext of playing, and meanwhile
they are examining the locks, bolts, chests, and
windows, and some fine morning we hear that such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1302">[Pg 1302]</span>
one has had his throat cut in his bed; that his wife has
been murdered, his children strangled, and his house
rifled from top to bottom. The wretches should be
strung up without mercy! Then we might have some
peace.” “The whole village will turn out to see them
hanged,” said Mother Grédel, “and as for me, it will
be the happiest day of my life.” “Do you know, if it
hadn’t been for Dean Daniel’s watch, no trace of them
would have been found. Last night the watch disappeared,
and this morning the Dean notified the police.
An hour later, Madoc bagged them all! Ha! Ha!
Ha!” The entire roomful burst out laughing,
and I trembled with shame, indignation, and fear
in turn.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the night drew on. Only a few loungers
remained. The people of the inn, who had sat up the
night before, were anxious to get to bed. I heard the
landlady yawn and mutter: “Oh, dear! How long
before we can get some sleep?” Most of the tipplers
comprehended the force of this remark and withdrew;
only one remained, sitting half asleep before his glass.
The watchman, going his rounds, woke him up and
he went off grumbling and staggering.</p>

<p>“At last!” I said to myself; “this is good luck;
Mother Grédel has gone to bed and Annette will not
be slow in getting me out.” With this agreeable prospect
in view, I had already stretched out my stiffened
limbs, when Dame Grédel’s voice reached my ear:
“Annette, go and lock up, and don’t forget to bolt
the door! I am going down cellar.” It appeared that
this was a wise custom of hers to assure herself that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1303">[Pg 1303]</span>
everything was right. “But, madame,” stammered
the girl, “the cask isn’t empty. You needn’t bother
to—” “Mind your own business,” interrupted the
mistress, whose candle was already lighting up the
passageway. I had barely time to squat down again
behind the cask, when the old woman, stooping beneath
the low, dingy ceiling, passed from one keg to
another, mumbling as she went: “Oh! the little wretch!
How she lets the wine leak. I’ll teach her to close the
spigots tighter; did ever any one see the like?” The
candle threw great shadows against the damp wall.
I huddled closer and closer. Suddenly, just as I
thought the visit happily ended, and was beginning
to breathe easier again, I heard the old creature give
a sigh so long and so full of woe that I knew something
unusual was happening. I risked just the least glance,
and I saw Dame Grédel Dick, her under jaw dropped
and her eyes sticking out of her head, staring at the
bottom of the barrel behind which I lay. She had
caught sight of one of my feet underneath the joist
that served as a wedge to keep the cask in place. She
evidently believed she had discovered the chief of the
robbers concealed there for the purpose of strangling
her during the night. I formed a sudden resolution.
“Madame, for God’s sake, have pity on me!” I cried:
“I am—” Without looking at me, or listening to a
word I said, she set up an ear-splitting shriek and
started up the stairs as quickly as her great weight
would permit. Seized with inexpressible terror, I
clung to her skirt and went down on my knees. This
only made matters worse. “Help! seize the assassin!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1304">[Pg 1304]</span>
Oh, my God! release me! Take my money! Oh!
Oh!”</p>

<p>It was horrible. In vain did I cry: “Only look at
me, my dear madame; I am not what you think me!”
She was beside herself with fear; she raved and
screamed in such piercing tones that had we not been
underground, the whole neighborhood would inevitably
have been aroused. In this extremity, consulting only
my rage, I overturned her, and gaining the door before
her, I slammed it in her face, taking care to slip
the bolt. During the struggle the candle had been
extinguished and Dame Grédel was left in the dark.
Her cries grew fainter and fainter. I stared at Annette,
giddy, and with hardly strength enough left to
stand. Her agitation equaled mine. We neither of
us seemed able to speak, and stood listening to the
expiring cries of the mistress, which soon ceased altogether.
The poor woman had fainted.</p>

<p>“Oh! Kasper,” cried Annette, wringing her hands,
“what is to be done? Fly! fly! You may have been
heard! Did you kill her?” “Kill her? I?” “I am
so glad! But fly! I will open the door for you.”
She unbarred it, and I fled into the street, without
stopping even to thank her; but I was so terrified and
there was not a moment to lose. The night was inky
black; not a star in the sky, and the street lamps unlighted.
The weather was abominable; it was snowing
hard and the wind howled dismally. Not until
I had run for a good half-hour did I stop to take
breath. You may imagine my horror when looking up
I found myself directly opposite the Pied de Mouton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1305">[Pg 1305]</span>
Tavern. In my terror I had run around the square a
half dozen times for aught I knew. My legs felt like
lead and my knees tottered under me.</p>

<p>The inn, but a moment before deserted, swarmed
like a bee-hive, and lights danced about from window
to window. It was evidently filled with the police.
And now, at my wits’ end, desperate, exhausted with
cold and hunger, and not knowing where to find refuge,
I resolved upon the strangest possible course.
“By Jove,” I said to myself, “as well be hanged as
leave my bones on the road to the Black Forest.” And
I walked into the tavern with the intention of giving
myself up to the officials. Besides the fellows with
their cocked hats tilted rakishly over their ears, and
the clubs fastened to their wrists, whom I had already
seen in the morning, and who were now running here
and there, and turning everything upside down, there
was the bailiff, Zimmer, standing before one of the
tables, dressed in black, with a grave air and penetrating
glance, and near him the secretary Roth, with
his red wig, imposing countenance, and large ears,
flat as oyster shells. They paid no attention to my
entrance, and this circumstance altered my resolution
at once. I sat down in a corner of the room behind
the big cast-iron stove, in company with two or three
of the neighbors, who had run hither to see what was
going on, and I ordered a pint of wine and a dish of
sauerkraut. Annette came near betraying me. “Goodness!”
she cried, “is it possible!” But one exclamation,
more or less, in such a babel of voices possessed but
little significance. It passed unnoticed, and, while I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1306">[Pg 1306]</span>
ate with a ravenous appetite, I listened to the examination
to which Dame Grédel was subjected as she
lay back in a large armchair, her hair falling down
and her eyes bulged out with fright. “How old
did the man appear to be?” asked the bailiff. “Between
forty and fifty, sir. He was an enormous man
with black side whiskers, or maybe brown, I don’t
exactly remember, with a long nose and green eyes.”
“Did he have any birth-mark or scars?” “I don’t remember
any. He only had a big hammer and pistols.”
“Very good! And what did he say to you?” “He
seized me by the throat, but fortunately I screamed
so loud it frightened him, and I defended myself with
my finger-nails. When any one tries to murder you,
you fight hard for your life, sir.” “Nothing is more
natural or legitimate, madame. Take this down, Roth!
The coolness of this good woman is truly remarkable.”
The rest of the deposition was in the same strain.
They questioned Annette afterward, but she testified
to having been so frightened that she could remember
nothing.</p>

<p>“That will do,” said the bailiff; “if we need anything
further, we will return to-morrow morning.”
Everybody withdrew, and I asked Dame Grédel for
a room for the night. So great had been her fear that
she had not the slightest recollection of having seen
me before. “Annette,” said she, “Show the gentleman
to the little room on the third floor. I can not stand
on my legs. Oh! dear! what trials we have to bear in
this world.” She began to weep.</p>

<p>Annette, having lighted a candle, led me up to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1307">[Pg 1307]</span>
little chamber, and when we found ourselves alone,
she cried innocently: “Oh! Kasper, Kasper! Who
would have believed that you were one of the band!
I can never console myself for having loved a robber!”
“What! you, too, believe us guilty, Annette?”
I exclaimed despairingly, dropping into a chair; “that
is the last straw on the camel’s back.” “No! no! you
can not be. You are too much of a gentleman, dear
Kasper! And you were so brave to come back.” I
explained to her that I was perishing with cold and
hunger, and that that was the only consideration which
led me to return.</p>

<p>We were left to ourselves for some time; then Annette
departed, lest she should arouse Madame Grédel’s
suspicions. Left to myself, after having ascertained
that the windows were not approached by any wall,
and that the sashes were securely fastened, I thanked
God that I had thus far been brought safely through
the perils which surrounded me, and then going to
bed, I was soon fast asleep.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>I got up at about eight o’clock the next morning.
It was foggy and dark. As I drew aside the hangings
of the bed, I noticed that the snow was drifted
on a level with the windows; the sashes were all white.
I began to reflect upon the sad condition of my companions;
they must have suffered with the cold, particularly
old Bremer and Bertha, and the idea filled
me with sorrow. As I was reflecting thus, a strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1308">[Pg 1308]</span>
noise arose outside. It drew near the inn, and I
sprang anxiously to the window to see if some new
dangers were threatening. They were bringing the
famous band of robbers to confront Dame Grédel
Dick, who was not yet sufficiently recovered from her
fright to venture out of doors. My poor comrades
came down the street between a double file of police,
and followed by a crowd of street urchins, who
screamed and yelled like savages. It seems to me that
I can still see that terrible scene: poor Bremer chained
between his sons, Ludwig and Karl, Wilfred behind
them, and Bertha bringing up the rear and crying
piteously: “In the name of Heaven, my masters, have
pity on a poor, innocent harpist! I kill? I steal? O
God! can it be?” She wrung her hands distractedly.
The others proceeded with bowed heads, their hair
falling over their faces.</p>

<p>The crowd swarmed into the dark alleyway of the
inn. The guards drove back the rabble, and the door
was closed and barred. The eager crowd remained
outside, standing ankle-deep in slush, with their noses
flattened against the panes. A profound silence settled
upon the house. Having by this time got into
my clothes, I opened the door part way to listen, and
see if it would be possible to escape from my unpleasant
quarters. I heard the sound of voices and of people
moving about on the lower floors, which convinced
me that the passages were strongly guarded. My door
opened on the landing, directly opposite the window
through which the man had fled two nights before.
I did not pay any attention to this circumstance at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1309">[Pg 1309]</span>
first, but as I stood there I suddenly noticed that the
window was open, and that there was no snow on the
sill; approaching it, I saw fresh tracks along the wall.
I shuddered. The man must have returned last night;
perhaps visited the inn every night. It was a revelation
to me, and at once the mystery began to clear up.</p>

<p>“Oh! if it were only true,” I said to myself, “that
fortune had placed the murderer’s fate in my hands,
my unhappy fellows would be saved!” And I followed
with my eyes the footprints, which led with surprising
distinctness to the opposite roof. At this moment some
words fell on my ear. The door of the dining hall
had just been opened to let in the fresh air, and I
heard the following conversation: “Do you recall having
taken part in the murder of Ulmet Elias on the
twentieth of this month?” Some unintelligible words
followed, “Close the door, Madoc!” said the bailiff;
“the woman is ill.” I heard no more. As I stood with
my head resting against the balusters, a sudden resolution
seized me. “I can save my comrades!” I exclaimed;
“God has pointed out to me the means, and
if I fail to do my duty, their blood will be upon my
head. My self-respect and peace of mind will be forever
lost, and I shall consider myself the most cowardly
of wretches.” It took me some time, however,
to summon up resolution enough. Then I went downstairs
and entered the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see this watch before?” the bailiff
was saying to Dame Grédel. “Do your best to remember!”
Without waiting for her answer, I stepped
forward and replied firmly: “That watch, bailiff? I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1310">[Pg 1310]</span>
have seen it before in the hands of the murderer himself.
I recognize it perfectly, and if you will only
listen to me, I will agree to deliver the man into your
hands this very night.” Perfect stillness followed my
bold declaration. The officials stared at each other,
dumfounded; my comrades seemed to cheer up a bit.
“I am the companion of these unfortunate people,”
I continued, “and I say it without shame, for every
one of them is honest, even if he is poor, and there
is not one among them capable of committing the
crimes imputed to him.”</p>

<p>Again silence followed. Dame Bertha began to
weep quietly. At last the bailiff aroused himself.
Looking at me sharply, he said: “Where do you pretend
to deliver the assassin into our hands?” “Right
here in this very house! And to convince you of it,
I only ask for a moment’s private conversation.”
“Let us hear what you have to say,” he replied, rising.
He motioned Madoc to follow us; the others remained.
We left the room. I went hastily up the stairs, with
the others at my heels. Pausing at the window on
the third floor, I showed them the man’s footprints
in the snow. “Those are the murderer’s tracks!” I
said; “he visits this house every night. Yesterday he
came at two in the morning; last night he returned,
and he will undoubtedly be back again this evening.”</p>

<p>The bailiff and Madoc examined the footprints without
a word. “How do you know that these are the
murderer’s tracks?” asked the chief of police, doubtfully.
Thereupon I told him of the man’s appearance
in our loft. I pointed out to them the little window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1311">[Pg 1311]</span>
above us through which I had watched him as he fled
in the moonlight, and which Wilfred had not seen,
as he remained in bed. I admitted that it was mere
chance that had led me to the discovery of the tracks
made the night before.</p>

<p>“It is strange!” muttered the bailiff; “this greatly
modifies the position of the accused. But how do you
explain the presence of the robber in the cellar?”
“That robber was myself.” I now related briefly
everything that had taken place from the time of my
comrades’ arrest until the moment of my flight from
the inn. “That will do,” said the bailiff; and, turning
toward the chief of police, he added: “I must admit,
Madoc, that the depositions of these musicians never
seemed to me very conclusive of their guilt; moreover,
their passports established an alibi difficult to controvert.
Nevertheless, young man,” turning to me, “in
spite of the plausibility of the proofs you have given
us, you must remain in our power until they are verified.
Keep him in sight, Madoc, and take your measures
accordingly.” The bailiff descended the stairs
thoughtfully, and, refolding his papers, he said, without
continuing the examination: “Let the accused be
taken back to the prison!” And with a scornful glance
at the landlady, he departed, followed by the secretary.
Madoc alone remained with two officials.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he said to Dame Grédel, “maintain the
strictest secrecy about what has happened, and give
this brave young man the same room he occupied night
before last.” Madoc’s look and emphasis admitted of
no reply. Dame Grédel swore she would do whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1312">[Pg 1312]</span>
was required of her if she could only be rid of the
robbers! Madoc replied: “We shall stay here all day
and to-night to protect you. Go about your work in
peace, and begin by giving us some breakfast. My
good fellow, you will give us the pleasure of dining
with us?” My situation did not permit me to decline.
I accepted accordingly, and we soon found ourselves
seated before a leg of ham and a jug of Rhine wine.
Other people arrived from time to time, and endeavored
to elicit the confidence of Dame Grédel and
Annette, but they maintained a discreet silence, for
which they deserve no little credit. We spent the afternoon
smoking our pipes and emptying our mugs; no
one paid any attention to us.</p>

<p>The chief of police, in spite of his sallow face,
piercing glance, pale lips, and sharp nose, was excellent
company after a bottle or two; he told us some
excellent stories, and at every word of his the other
two burst out laughing. I remained gloomy and silent.
“Come, my dear young fellow!” he said to me with a
smile, “forget for a little the death of your respectable
grandmother. Take a drop, and put your troublesome
thoughts to flight.”</p>

<p>Others joined in the conversation, and the time
passed in the midst of tobacco smoke, the clinking of
glasses, and the ringing of mugs. But at nine o’clock,
after the watchman’s visit, the expression of things
changed. Madoc rose and said: “Well, my friends,
let us proceed to business. Fasten the doors and shutters
quietly! You, ladies, may go to bed!” His two
tattered followers looked more like robbers themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1313">[Pg 1313]</span>
than like props of law and order. Each drew a club
with a knob of lead attached to one end, from his
trousers’ leg, and Madoc tapped his breast pocket to
make sure that his pistol was there. This done, he
bid me lead them to the loft. We climbed the stairs.
Having reached the little room, where thoughtful little
Annette had taken care to light a fire, Madoc, cursing
between his teeth, hastened to throw water on the coals;
then motioning to the pile of straw, he said to me:
“You may go to sleep if you like.”</p>

<p>He sat down, together with his two acolytes, at the
end of the room close to the wall, and they put out
the light. I lay down on the straw, breathing a prayer
to the Almighty to send hither the assassin. After
midnight the silence became so profound that you
would never have suspected three men were there with
wide-open eyes, on the alert for the slightest sound.
The hours wore slowly away. I could not sleep. A
thousand terrible ideas teemed in my brain. One
o’clock—two o’clock—three o’clock struck, and nothing
appeared. At three o’clock one of the officials
stirred slightly. I thought the man had come at last.
But again all was still. I began to think that Madoc
would take me for an impostor, as he must be only
too ready to do, and that in the morning things would
fare badly with me; thus, instead of helping my companions,
I should only be fettered with them.</p>

<p>The time seemed to me to pass very rapidly after
three o’clock. I wished the night might last forever,
that the only ray of hope might not be gone. I was
starting to go over all these thoughts for the fiftieth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1314">[Pg 1314]</span>
time, when, suddenly, without my having heard a
sound, the window opened and two eyes glistened in
the opening. Nothing stirred in the loft. “The others
are asleep,” I thought. The head remained in the
opening, listening. The wretch seemed to suspect
something. My heart galloped and the blood coursed
through my veins. I dared not even breathe. A few
moments passed thus. Then, suddenly, the man seemed
to make up his mind. He let himself down into the
loft with the same caution as on the preceding night.
On the instant a terrible cry, short, piercing, blood-curdling,
resounded through the house. “We’ve got
him!”</p>

<p>The whole house shook from cellar to attic; cries,
struggles, and hoarse shouts, coupled with muttered
oaths, filled the loft. The man roared like a wild
beast, and his opponents breathed painfully as they
battled with his terrible strength. Then there was a
crash that made the flooring creak, and I heard nothing
more but a gritting of teeth and a rattle of chains.
“A light here!” cried the formidable Madoc. And as
the sulphur burned, illuminating the place with its
bluish light, I vaguely distinguished the forms of the
three officials kneeling above the prostrate man. One
of them was holding him by the throat, another had
sunk his knees into his chest, and Madoc encircled his
wrists with handcuffs hard enough to crush them. The
man, in his shirt sleeves as before, seemed inert, save
that one of his powerful legs, naked from the knee
to the ankle, raised up from time to time and struck
the floor with a convulsive movement. His eyes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1315">[Pg 1315]</span>
literally starting from his head, and his lips were covered
with a bloody foam. Scarcely had I lighted the
taper when the officials exclaimed, thunderstruck:
“Our Dean!” All three got up and stood staring at
each other, white with astonishment. The bloodshot
eyes of the murderer turned on Madoc. He tried to
speak, and after a moment I heard him murmur: “What
a terrible dream! My God, what a terrible dream!”
Then he sighed and became motionless.</p>

<p>I approached to take a look at him. It was indeed
the man who had given us advice on the road to
Heidelberg. Perhaps he had had a presentiment that
we would be the means of his destruction, for people
do sometimes have these terrible forebodings. As he
did not stir, and a tiny stream of blood flowed on the
dusty floor, Madoc, rousing himself from his stupor,
bent over him and tore away his shirt; we then saw
that he had stabbed himself to the heart with his great
knife. “Ho! ho!” cried Madoc, with a sinister smile,
“our Dean has cheated the gallows. You others stay
here while I go and notify the bailiff.” He picked up
his hat, that had fallen off during the mêlée, and left
without another word. I remained opposite the corpse,
with the two others.</p>

<p>The news spread like wildfire. It was a sensation
for the neighborhood. Dean Daniel Van den Berg
enjoyed a fortune and a reputation so well established
that many people refused to believe in the abominable
instincts which dominated him. The matter was discussed
from every conceivable point of view. Some
held that he was a somnambulist and irresponsible for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1316">[Pg 1316]</span>
his acts; others that he was a murderer through love
of blood, having no other possible motive for committing
these crimes. Perhaps both were right, for it is
an undeniable fact that moral being, will, soul, whatever
name you choose to call it by, is wanting in the
somnambulist. The animal nature left to itself naturally
yields to the dictates of its pacific or sanguinary
instincts. Be that as it may, my comrades were at
once restored to liberty. Little Annette was quoted
for a long time after as a model of devotion. She was
even sought in marriage by the son of the burgomaster
Trungott, a romantic youth, who will one day
disgrace his family.</p>

<p>As for me, I lost no time in returning to the Black
Forest, where, since that time I have officiated as
leader of the orchestra at the Sabre Vert Tavern, on
the road to Tubingen. If you should ever happen to
pass that way, and my story has interested you, come
in and see me. We will drink a bottle or two together,
and I will relate to you certain details that will make
your hair stand on end.</p>

<p><em>Alphonse Daudet, best known among English-speaking
people perhaps as author of the
humorous “Tartarin de Tarascon,” written in
1872, was born at Nîmes, 1840, and died at
Paris, 1897. For such novels as “Sapho,” “Sidonie,”
“Numa Roumestan,” etc., he has been
called a stern censor, unsparing in his exposition
of, and satire on, the weakness and hypocrisy
of human nature. But that he has a
warm, sympathetic side to his nature, too, is
plain enough in the following story, which, on
the whole, is an almost perfect example of
Daudet’s art. Jules Claretie said of him that
he was a “winged realist,” with a lightness and
depth of touch that yet never forgot the realities
of life. He was subjective, not objective.</em></p>

<p>I know not if it be from lack of habit, but I can
never enter the Palais de Justice without an
uneasiness, an inexplicable heart pang. That
grating, those great courts, that stone staircase so vast
that every one mounts it in isolation, enveloped in his
individual torment. The antiquity of the structures,
the melancholy clock, the height of the windows, and
also the mist of the quay, that moisture that clings to
walls that skirt the water, all give you a foretaste of
the neighboring prison. In the halls the impression
is the same, or more vivid still, because of the peculiar
company which peoples them, because of those long
black robes which make the solemn gestures, because of
those who accuse, and the unintelligible records, the
eternal records spread out everywhere on the tables,
carried under the arms in enormous bundles, overflowing—</p>

<p>There are great green doors, noiseless and mysterious,
from whence escape—when they are ajar—gusts
of voices severe or weeping, and visions of school
benches, platforms black with caps, and great crucifixes
leaning forward. Muskets ring out on the flags.
Sinister rumblings of carriages pass shaking the
arches. All these noises blended together are like a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1320">[Pg 1320]</span>respiration, the panting breath of a factory, the apparatus
of justice at work. And hearing this terrible
machine at labor, one desires to shrink within himself,
to dwindle for fear of being caught, even by a hair,
in this formidable gearing which one knows to be so
complicated, tenacious, destructive—</p>

<p>I was thinking of this the other morning, in going
to see an examining magistrate before whom I had,
in behalf of a poor devil, to recommend a stay of proceedings.
The hall of witnesses, where I was waiting,
was full of people, sheriff’s officers, clerks engrossing
behind a glass partition, witnesses whispering to each
other in advance of their depositions, women of the
people, impressive and garrulous who were telling the
officers their entire lives in order to arrive at the affair
that had brought them there. Near me, an open
door lit the sombre lobby of the examining magistrate,
a lobby which leads everywhere, even to the scaffold,
and from which the prisoners issue as accused. Some
of these unfortunates, brought there under a strong
escort by way of the staircase of la Conciergerie, lay
about on the benches awaiting their turn to be interrogated,
and it is in this ante-chamber of the convict
prison that I overheard a lovers’ dialogue, an idyl of
the faubourg, as impassioned as “l’Oarystis,” but more
heartbreaking—Yes, in the midst of this shadow,
where so many criminals have left something of their
shuddering, of their hopes, and of their rages, I saw
two beings love, and smile; and however lowly was
this love, however faded was this smile, the old lobby
must have been as astonished by it as would a miry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1321">[Pg 1321]</span>
and black street of Paris, if penetrated by the cooing
of a turtle-dove.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In a listless attitude, almost unconscious, a young
girl was seated at the end of a bench, quiet as a working
woman who waits the price of her day’s labor.
She wore the calico bonnet, and the sad costume of
Saint-Lazare with an air of repose and of well-being,
as though the prison régime were the best thing she
had found in all her life. The guard, who sat beside
her, seemed to find her much to his taste, and they
laughed together softly. At the other end of the
lobby, wholly in the shadow, was seated, handcuffs on
wrists, the Desgrieux of this Manon. She had not
seen him at first; but as soon as her eyes became accustomed
to the darkness, she perceived him and trembled:
“Why, that’s Pignou—hé! Pignou!”—</p>

<p>The guard silenced her. The prisoners are expressly
forbidden to talk to each other.</p>

<p>“Oh! I beg of you, only one word!” she said, leaning
far forward toward the remotest part of the
lobby.</p>

<p>But the soldier remained inflexible. “No—no—it
can’t be done—only if you have some message to give
him, tell it to me, I will repeat it to him.”</p>

<p>Then a dialogue was entered into between this girl
and her Pignou, with the guard as interpreter.</p>

<p>Much moved, without heeding those about her, she
began:</p>

<p>“Tell him I have never loved any one but him; that
I will never love another in all my life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1322">[Pg 1322]</span></p>

<p>The guard made a number of steps in the lobby,
and redoubling his gravity as though to take from the
proceeding all that was too kindly, he repeated: “She
says she has never loved but you, and that she’ll never
love another.”</p>

<p>I heard a grumbling, a confused stammering
which must have been the response of Pignou, then
the guard went back with measured step toward
the bench.</p>

<p>“What did he say?” demanded the child all anxious,
and as though waiting were too long: “Well, tell me
what he said now?”</p>

<p>“He said he was very miserable!”—</p>

<p>Then, carried away by her emotion and the custom
of the noisy and communicative streets, she cried out
loud:</p>

<p>“Don’t be weary, m’ami—the good days will come
again!”</p>

<p>And in this voice, still young, there was something
piteous, almost maternal. Plainly this was the woman
of the people with her courage under affliction and
her dog-like devotion.</p>

<p>From the depths of the lobby, a voice replied, the
voice of Pignou, wine-soaked, torn, burned with
alcohol:</p>

<p>“Va donc! the good days—I’ll have them at the
end of my five years.”</p>

<p>He knew his case well, that one!—</p>

<p>The guards cried: “Chut!—Keep quiet!”—But
too late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1323">[Pg 1323]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A door had opened, and the examining magistrate
himself appeared on the sill.</p>

<p>Skull-cap of velvet, grizzled whiskers, mouth thin
and evil, the eye scrutinizing, distrustful, but not
profound, it was just the type of an examining magistrate,
one of those men who thinks he has a criminal
before him always, like those doctors of the insane
who see maniacs everywhere. That one in particular
had a certain way of looking at you, so annoying, and
so insulting, that you felt guilty without having done
anything. With one glance of the eye he terrified all
the lobby: “What does all this noise mean?—Try to
do your duty a little better,” he said, addressing the
guards. Then he closed his door with a sharp click.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The municipal guard taken to task, red, mortified,
looked around a moment for some one upon whom to
lay the blame. But the little girl said nothing more,
Pignou sat quiet on his bench—All at once he perceived
me, and as I was at the door of the hall, almost
in the lobby, he took me by the arm and jerked me
around brutally.</p>

<p>“What are you doing there, you?”</p>

<p>The child was lying stretched out in his little,
white bed, and his eyes, grown large through
fever, looked straight before him, always
with the strange fixity of the sick who already perceive
what the living do not see.</p>

<p>The mother at the foot of the bed, torn by suffering
and wringing her hands to keep herself from crying,
anxiously followed the progress of the disease on the
poor, emaciated face of the little being. The father,
an honest workman, kept back the tears which burned
his eyelids.</p>

<p>The day broke clear and mild, a beautiful morning
in June, and lighted up the narrow room in the street
of the Abessess where little François, the child of
Jacques and Madeleine Legrand, lay dying. He was
seven years old and was very fair, very rosy, and so
lively. Not three weeks ago he was gay as a sparrow;
but a fever had seized him and they had brought him
home one evening from the public school with his
head heavy and his hands very hot. From that time
he had been here in this bed and sometimes in his delirium
when he looked at his little well-blackened
shoes, which his mother had carefully placed in a
corner on a board, he said:</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1328">[Pg 1328]</span></p>

<p>“You can throw them away now, little François’
shoes! Little François will not put them on any more!
Little François will not go to school any more—never,
never!”</p>

<p>Then the father cried out and said: “Wilt thou be
still!” And the mother, very pale, buried her blond
head in his pillow so that little François could not
hear her weep.</p>

<p>This night the child had not been delirious; but for
the two days past the doctor had been uneasy over an
odd sort of prostration which resembled abandon, it
was as if at seven years the sick one already felt the
weariness of life. He was tired, silent, sad, and
tossed his little head about on the bolster. He had no
longer a smile on his poor, thin lips, and with haggard
eyes he sought, seeing they knew not what, something
there beyond, very far off—</p>

<p>In Heaven! Perhaps! thought Madeleine, trembling.</p>

<p>When they wished him to take some medicine, some
sirup, or a little soup, he refused. He refused everything.</p>

<p>“Dost thou wish anything, François?”</p>

<p>“No, I wish nothing!”</p>

<p>“We must draw him out of this,” the doctor said.
“This torpor frightens me!—you are the father and
the mother, you know your child well—Seek for
something to reanimate this little body, recall to earth
this spirit which runs after the clouds!”</p>

<p>Then he went away.</p>

<p>“Seek!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1329">[Pg 1329]</span></p>

<p>Yes, without doubt they knew him well, their François,
these worthy people! They knew how it amused
him, the little one, to plunder the hedges on Sunday
and to come back to Paris on his father’s shoulders
laden with hawthorne—Jacques Legrand had bought
some images, some gilded soldiers, and some Chinese
shadows for François; he cut them out, put them on
the child’s bed and made them dance before the bewildered
eyes of the little one, and with a desire to
weep himself he tried to make him laugh.</p>

<p>“Dost thou see, it is the broken bridge—Tire
tire tire!—And that is a general!—Thou rememberest
we saw one, a general, once, in the Bois de Boulogne?—If
thou takest thy medicine well I will buy
thee a real one with a cloth tunic and gold epaulets—Dost
thou wish for him, the general, say?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the child, with the dry voice which
fever gives.</p>

<p>“Dost thou wish a pistol, some marbles—a crossbow?”</p>

<p>“No,” repeated the little voice, clearly and almost
cruelly.</p>

<p>And to all that they said to him, to all the jumping-jacks,
to all the balloons that they promised him, the
little voice—while the parents looked at each other in
despair—responded:</p>

<p>“No.”—“No.”—“No!”</p>

<p>“But what dost thou wish, my François?” asked
the mother. “Let us see, there is certainly something
thou wouldst like to have—Tell it, tell it to me! to
me!—thy mother!” And she laid her cheek on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1330">[Pg 1330]</span>
pillow of the sick boy and whispered this softly in his
ear as if it were a secret. Then the child, with an odd
accent, straightening himself up in his bed and stretching
out his hand eagerly toward some invisible thing,
replied suddenly in an ardent tone, at the same time
supplicating and imperative:</p>

<p>“I want Boum-Boum!”</p>

<p>Boum-Boum.</p>

<p>Poor Madeleine threw a frightened look toward her
husband. What did the little one say? Was it the
delirium, the frightful delirium, which had come back
again?</p>

<p>Boum-Boum!</p>

<p>She did not know what that meant, and she was
afraid of these singular words which the child repeated
with a sickly persistence as if, not having dared
until now to formulate his dream, he grasped the
present time with invincible obstinacy:</p>

<p>“Yes, Boum-Boum! Boum-Boum! I want Boum-Boum!”</p>

<p>The mother had seized Jacques’s hand and spoke
very low, as if demented.</p>

<p>“What does that mean, Jacques? He is lost!”</p>

<p>But the father had on his rough, working man’s
face a smile almost happy, but astonished too, the
smile of a condemned man who foresees a possibility
of liberty.</p>

<p>Boum-Boum! He remembered well the morning of
Easter Monday when he had taken François to the
circus. He had still in his ears the child’s outbursts
of joy, the happy laugh of the amused boy, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1331">[Pg 1331]</span>
clown, the beautiful clown, all spangled with gold and
with a great gilded butterfly sparkling, many-colored,
on the back of his black costume, skipped across the
track, gave the trip to a rider or held himself motionless
and stiff on the sand, his head down and his feet
in the air. Or again he tossed up to the chandelier
some soft, felt hats which he caught adroitly on his
head, where they formed, one by one, a pyramid; and
at each jest, like a refrain brightening up his intelligent
and droll face, he uttered the same cry, repeated
the same word, accompanied now and then by a burst
from the orchestra: Boum-Boum!</p>

<p>Boum-Boum! and each time that it rang out,
Boum-Boum, the audience burst out into hurrahs and
the little one joined in with his hearty, little laugh.
Boum-Boum! It was this Boum-Boum, it was the
clown of the circus, it was this favorite of a large
part of the city that little François wished to see and
to have and whom he could not have and could not
see since he was lying here without strength in his
white bed.</p>

<p>In the evening Jacques Legrand brought the child
a jointed clown, all stitched with spangles, which he
had bought in a passageway and which was very expensive.
It was the price of four of his working
days! But he would have given twenty, thirty, he
would have given the price of a year’s labor to bring
back a smile to the pale lips of the sick child.</p>

<p>The child looked at the plaything a moment as it
glistened on the white cover of the bed, then said,
sadly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1332">[Pg 1332]</span></p>

<p>“It is not Boum-Boum!—I want to see Boum-Boum!”</p>

<p>Ah! if Jacques could have wrapped him up in his
blankets, could have carried him to the circus, could
have shown him the clown dancing under the lighted
chandelier and have said to him, Look! He did better,
Jacques, he went to the circus, demanded the address
of the clown, and timidly, his legs shaking with fear,
he climbed, one by one, the steps which led to the
apartment of the artist, at Montmartre. It was very
bold this that Jacques was going to do! But after all
the comedians go to sing and recite their monologues
in drawing-rooms, at the houses of the great lords.
Perhaps the clown—oh! if he only would—would consent
to come and say good-day to François. No matter,
how would they receive him, Jacques Legrand,
here at Boum-Boum’s house?</p>

<p>He was no longer Boum-Boum! He was Monsieur
Moreno, and, in the artistic dwelling, the books, the
engravings, the elegance was like a choice decoration
around the charming man who received Jacques in
his office like that of a doctor.</p>

<p>Jacques looked, but did not recognize the clown,
and turned and twisted his felt hat between his
fingers. The other waited. Then the father excused
himself. “It was astonishing what he came there
to ask, it could not be—pardon, excuse—But in
short, it was concerning the little one—A nice
little one, monsieur. And so intelligent! Always
the first at school, except in arithmetic, which
he did not understand—A dreamer, this little one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1333">[Pg 1333]</span>
do you see! Yes, a dreamer. And the proof—wait—the
proof—”</p>

<p>Jacques now hesitated, stammered; but he gathered
up his courage and said bruskly:</p>

<p>“The proof is that he wishes to see you, that he
thinks only of you, and that you are there before
him like a star which he would like to have, and
that he looks—”</p>

<p>When he had finished the father was deadly pale
and he had great drops on his forehead. He dared
not look at the clown who remained with his
eyes fixed on the workman. And what was he
going to say, this Boum-Boum? Was he going
to dismiss him, take him for a fool and put him
out the door?</p>

<p>“You live?” asked Boum-Boum.</p>

<p>“Oh! very near! Street of the Abessess!”</p>

<p>“Come!” said the other. “Your boy wants to see
Boum-Boum? Ah, well, he is going to see Boum-Boum.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When the door opened and showed the clown,
Jacques Legrand cried out joyfully to his son:</p>

<p>“François, be happy, child! See, here he is, Boum-Boum!”</p>

<p>A look of great joy came over the child’s face. He
raised himself on his mother’s arm and turned his
head toward the two men who approached, questioning,
for a moment, who it was by the side of his
father; this gentleman in an overcoat, whose good,
pleasant face he did not know. When they said to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1334">[Pg 1334]</span>
him: “It is Boum-Boum!” he slowly fell back on the
pillow and remained there, his eyes fixed, his beautiful
large, blue eyes, which looked beyond the walls of the
little room, and were always seeking the spangles and
the butterfly of Boum-Boum, like a lover who pursues
his dream.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the child with a voice which was no
longer dry, but full of despair, “no, it is not Boum-Boum.”</p>

<p>The clown, standing near the little bed, threw upon
the child an earnest look, very grave, but of an inexpressible
sweetness.</p>

<p>He shook his head, looked at the anxious father,
the grief-stricken mother, and said, smiling, “He is
right, this is not Boum-Boum!” and then he went out.</p>

<p>“I can not see him, I will never see Boum-Boum any
more!” repeated the child, whose little voice spoke to
the angels. “Boum-Boum is perhaps there, there,
where little François will soon go.”</p>

<p>And suddenly—it was only a half-hour since the
clown had disappeared—the door opened quickly, and
in his black, spangled clothes, his yellow cap on his
head, the gilded butterfly on his breast and on his
back, with a smile as big as the mouth of a money-box
and a powdered face, Boum-Boum, the true Boum-Boum,
the Boum-Boum of the circus, the Boum-Boum
of the popular neighborhood, the Boum-Boum
of little François—Boum-Boum appeared.</p>

<p>Lying on his little white bed the child clapped his
thin, little hands, laughing, crying, happy, saved, with
a joy of life in his eyes, and cried “Bravo!” with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1335">[Pg 1335]</span>
seven-year gaiety, which all at once kindled up like
a match:</p>

<p>“Boum-Boum! It is he, it is he, this time! Here
is Boum-Boum! Long live Boum-Boum! Good-day,
Boum-Boum.”</p>

<p>And when the doctor came back, he found, seated
by little François’s bedside, a clown with a pale face,
who made the little one laugh again and again, and
who said to the child while he was stirring a piece of
sugar into a cup of medicine:</p>

<p>“Thou knowest, if thou dost not drink, little François,
Boum-Boum will not come back any more.”</p>

<p>So the child drank.</p>

<p>“Is it not good?”</p>

<p>“Very good!—thanks, Boum-Boum!”</p>

<p>“Doctor,” said the clown to the doctor, “do not be
jealous—It seems to me that my grimaces will do
him as much good as your prescriptions!”</p>

<p>The father and the mother wept, but this time
from joy.</p>

<p>Until little François was on his feet again a carriage
stopped every day before the dwelling of a
workman in the street of the Abessess, at Montmartre,
and a man got out with a gay powdered face,
enveloped in an overcoat with the collar turned back,
and underneath it one could see a clown’s costume.</p>

<p>“What do I owe you, monsieur?” said Jacques, at
last, to the master-clown when the child took his first
walk, “for now I owe you something!”</p>

<p>The clown stretched out his two soft, Herculean
hands to the parents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1336">[Pg 1336]</span></p>

<p>“A shake of the hand!” said he.</p>

<p>Then placing two great kisses on the once more
rosy cheeks of the child:</p>

<p>“And (laughing) permission to put on my visiting-card:</p>


<p class="center p2">“<span class="smcap">Boum-Boum</span></p>

<p class="center p1"><em>Acrobatic Doctor and Physician in ordinary<br> to little
François!</em>”</p>
